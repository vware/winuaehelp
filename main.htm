    <p><a href="credits/contrib.htm">WinUAE</a> is an Amiga
    Emulator for the Windows platform. It started out as port of
    the Ubiquitious Amiga Emulator (UAE) and has evolved since
    then. It is the collaborative effort of a number of Amiga
    enthusiasts to create a portable Amiga emulator under the
    <a href="credits/gpl.htm">GNU Public License</a>. Source code
    for all UAE versions is available so it can be studied, and
    help is always appreciated.</p><img class="center" src=

    <p>WinUAE allows you to run Amiga software in Windows,
    including games, demos, and applications. General compatibility
    is excellent, and there are a number of enhancements in WinUAE
    compared to a standard Amiga computer.</p>
