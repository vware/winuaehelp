    <p><a href="credits/contrib.htm">WinUAE</a> is a Amiga Emulator
    for the Windows platform. It started out as port of the
    Ubiquitious Amiga Emulator (UAE) and has evolved since then. It
    is the collaborative effort of a number of Amiga enthusiasts to
    create a portable Amiga emulator under the <a href=
    "credits/gpl.htm">GNU Public License</a>. Source code for all
    UAE versions is available so it can be studied, and help is
    always appreciated.</p><img class="center" src="logo.png" alt=
