    <p>Over the years, WinUAE has proven to be run pretty much all
    Amiga software ever created.</p>
    <p>If you have problems to get a certain program working, look
    at the <a href="links.htm#help">links page</a>. There you will
    find the most comprehensive emulation sites on the net.</p>
    <p>The number of programs that don't run has been reported to
    be close to zero. If you find a piece of software to require
    special treatment, please let the developers know. Look at the
    <a href="credits/about.htm">contacts page</a> to get in touch
    with the right people.</p>
    <p>Still, WinUAE is not perfect, but please check this list
    before reporting any bugs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some CD32 games stop loading and freeze (bug in the
      CD-ROM controller emulation, hard to fix because there are no
      CD32 hardware specs)</li>
      <li>Sound and JIT-sound timing problems (some systems
      only)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: Please use the following type of template with all bug
    reports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WinUAE Version</li>
      <li>Host Operating System (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 etc.)</li>
      <li>DirectX version</li>
      <li>PC Graphics card and the driver version</li>
      <li>Sound card and the driver version</li>
      <li>Amiga OS version (Kickstart and Workbench)</li>
      <li>Extensions running (MagicWB, NewIcons, DirOPUS,
      ToolManager, etc.)</li>
      <li>Amiga settings that may have caused the problem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you made sure your request is still valid, see the
    <a href="credits/contrib.htm">Credits</a> page to contact one
    of the developers.</p>
