    <p>Over the years, WinUAE has proven to be run pretty much all
    Amiga software ever created.</p>
    <p>If you have problems to get a certain program working, look
    at the <a href="links.htm#help">links page</a>, there are some
    great resources online which are also frequented by
    developers.</p>
    <p>Still, WinUAE is not perfect, so if you feel you need to
    report a bug, please use the following type of template with
    all bug reports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WinUAE Version</li>
      <li>Host Operating System (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 etc.)</li>
      <li>DirectX version</li>
      <li>PC Graphics card and the driver version</li>
      <li>Sound card and the driver version</li>
      <li>AmigaOS version (Kickstart and Workbench)</li>
