    <p>Over the years, WinUAE has been improved to the point where
    it almost all Amiga software ever created runs without
    problems.</p>
    <p>If you have problems to get a certain program working, look
    at the <a href="links.htm#help">links page</a>, there are some
    great resources online which are also frequented by
    developers.</p>
    <p>Still, WinUAE is not perfect, so if you feel you need to
    report a bug, please use the following type of template with
    all bug reports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WinUAE Version</li>
      <li>Host Operating System (Windows 7, 8, 10 etc.)</li>
      <li>DirectX version</li>
      <li>PC Graphics card and the driver version</li>
      <li>Sound card and the driver version</li>
      <li>AmigaOS version (Kickstart and Workbench)</li>
      <li>Extensions running (MagicWB, NewIcons, DirOPUS,
      ToolManager, etc.)</li>
      <li>Amiga settings that may have caused the problem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please be descriptive and as detailed as possible. The
    better the error report, the easier it will be for developers
    to reproduce the problem and fix it. Please see the <a href=
    "credits/contrib.htm">Credits</a> page to contact one of the
    developers.</p>
