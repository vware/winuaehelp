    <p>This page contains some hints which might help you to get
    happier with WinUAE.</p>
    <h2>Adjust the CPU Idle slider to save Money</h2>
    <p>Modern CPUs save much power when they have nothing to do,
    for example you write a text or work with your workbench hear
    MP3 music. A AMD64 CPU in IDLE mode consumes 10 Watts. In full
    load mode, it uses 83 Watt. A P4 Prescott with E0 Stepping also
    has the ability to save a lot of power. A Athlon XP must
    disconnect the system bus. In most BIOS settings, this option
    is disabled, because old CPUs have bugs in this feature. You
    may try and activate it, if your system works stable.<br>
    Using the CPU IDLE feature saves you money, allows for lower
    operating temperatures, and (if your fans are temperature
    controlled) less noise.</p>
    <p>In the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU tab</a> you can choose
    the optimal value for power saving. The CPU must be set to
    fastest possible in A500 mode. You must set the slider so far
    right, so that the Windows Task Manager shows about 10-15% CPU
    load. If you set it more right, you save more CPU load, but
    WinUAE will generally run slower. But if you are on the road
    with a notebook it may be a good choice to sacrifice speed for
    more runtime. You can avoid the clock being incorrect using the
    <a href="amigaprogs.htm">timehack program</a>.</p>
    <h2>Printing with WinUAE</h2>
    <p>Currently, there are 3 ways to print with WinUAE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the same way as classic a Amiga, you can set a
      parallel printer in the WinUAE settings tab <a href=
      "../gui/ports.htm">Game & I/O Ports</a>. Make sure Postscript
      detection and Post Script Printer Emulation are not checked.
      If you use Windows 2000 or above, set the autoflush timeout
      to 2. Now you can save your config and can start WinUAE and
      do the rest on the Amiga. If you use turboprint, do not use
      the turboprint spooler and chose parallel port or turbopar
      for the print device. If you print something you should see
      an entry in the Windows printer spooler.
      </li>
      <li>If you have a printer that the Amiga does not support,
      you can choose the Postscript output. For this you need to
      install GhostScript for Windows. In WinUAE, select the
      printer and check on Postscript detection and Post Script
      Printer Emulation. Note: You can not change these settings on
      the fly (when you press F12 during emulation).<br>
      Boot your emulated Amiga. There is a large probability that
      turboprint does not work with these printer settings, and
      prints out an empty page instead.<br>
      Remove turbostart if you have it and chose the Workbench
      Postscript Printer. Please note that the OS3.5 and OS3.9
      drivers crash when you use greyscale or black and white.
      Choose color instead. Set it on all printer preferences
      pages. You can chose the real output format in the Windows
      printer driver.<br>
      Note: Most of the time it is enough to use the Workbench
      printer with 300 dpi. Higher resolutions may not produce an
      visible advantage, but definitely cost time and space.<br>
      The printer must dither colors, so it is important here to
      chose 600 or 1200 dpi on the Windows side.<br>
      If you really want greyscale and black&amp;white from the
      Amiga side, use the driver from OS3.1 which works. The OS3.5
      and OS3.9 driver seem to have a compiler Bug, and this
      function also does not work on real Amigas.</li>
      <li>TurboPrint, GhostScript etc. are no longer required, or
      at least the EpsonQ emulator is the easiest way to print</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The uae_german keymap does not support µ or € Symbols</h2>
    <p>Recommended is the use of german_keymap_new.zip and input
    set to anything other than compatibility mode. See also the
    read-me of it. Works only on WinUAE 0.9.90 and above.</p>
    <h2>Using a mouse wheel</h2>
    <p>This work same as real Amiga. Use the tool Freewheel from
    AmiNet.</p>
    <h2>WinUAE does not accept my hardfiles or show only CLI with
    my always used config</h2>
    <p>This happens if a second instance of WinUAE is running. It
    is not allowed to use the same hardfile with multiple WinUAE
    sessions at the same time. In very rare situations a very bad
    Amiga program crash could happen and prevent WinUAE from
    releasing the hardfile. So you can not load it in when you quit
    and start WinUAE. In this case, free the handle to the file
    manually or reboot Windows. If WinUAE takes long to boot you
    can switch on drive LEDs in the GUI. If the hard drive LED is
    on you know the hardfile is valid.</p>
    <h2>After resuming from hybernate state, the Amiga Clock shows
    the wrong time</h2>
    <p>Use the <a href="amigaprogs.htm">Amiga program</a> timehack.
    This is maybe also useful if you throttled CPU idle too much
    because time can then run 3-10% slower.</p>
    <h2>How to make custom screen resolutions for WinUAE</h2>
    <p>Powerstrip works OK now since Version 3.3 and nVidia drivers
    version 40 or later, so please make sure you are using the
    latest version of Powerstrip and nVidia drivers.</p>
    <p>Create the modes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change into the menu display profile -&gt; configure</li>
      <li>Click advanced timing options -&gt; custom resolutions
      -&gt; user defined</li>
      <li>Set desired values and reboot windows if necessary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is also possible to create interlaced doublescan
    resolutions in this menu.</p>
    <h2>Using a real Amiga formatted HDD in WinUAE</h2>
    <p>This can be done in the <a href=
    "../gui/hard-drives.htm">hard drive page</a> in the GUI. If
    there is no drive listed, it is possible that this drive has no
    Amiga/Amithlon Partition.</p>
    <h2>I have several damaged Amigas - can i use the Kickstart
    from them?</h2>
    <p>Follow the instructions on the <a href=
    "../started/transrom.htm">Transrom</a> page.</p>
    <h2>Using other file systems on Hardfiles (SFS tested)</h2>
    <p>Create a Hardfile. For use with HDToolbox you must set the
    Sector Surface and Reserved numbers to 0. The volume name
    should show N/A. Make a hdtoolbox Icon with
    device=uaehf.device. Now do all steps like with a real Amiga
    with HDToolsBox..</p>
    <h2>The mouse pointer freezes sometimes and I have to
    reboot</h2>
    <p>Make sure you have the serial port enabled and correctly
    configured. Also, make sure the "Shared" check box is checked
    to loose no speed.</p>
    <h2>Differences of CD drivers</h2>
    <p>AsimCDFS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fails if you mount more than 1 CD drive (all devices show
      the same CD content)</li>
      <li>Seems to be a bug in AsimCDFS, because it happens on real
      Amigas as well</li>
    </ul>
    <p>cacheCDFS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set the MaxTransfer size to 0x10000 (65 kb) in the
      mountfile</li>
      <li>This make cacheCDFS working and not display the
      read/write error Requesters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Get UAE working in every dir/drive without changing
    configs</h2>
    <p>Make use of relative pathes to realize this.</p>
    <p>Example:<br>
    WinUAE is in C:\Amiga\WinUAE, and Kickstart ROMs are in
    C:\Amiga\Kickstart.<br>
    For the Kickstart path, enter ..\Kickstart.</p>
    <h2>UAE doesn't boot due to Picasso96 failure (Picasso96 is
    extremely slow)</h2>
    <p>Start UAE and immediately press both mouse buttons when the
    main window is shown. In the Amiga Early Startup select "Boot
    without Startup-Sequence". Now remove or move the uaegfx file
    in devs:monitors. Start UAE, now the Workbench shows up. Just
    select a AmigaMode Save and copy uaegfx to devs/monitors again.
    If this should fail, reinstall Picasso96.</p>
    <p>Don't forget to copy the rtg.library file, which can be
    found in the AmigaPrograms directory, to libs:picasso96.This is
    important for full speed of WinUAE.</p>
    <h2>A chipset mode that UAE does not display makes UAE
    fail</h2>
    <p>OS 3.1:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boot without aStartup-Sequence (from Amiga Early Startup
      menu), type loadwb in the CLI, and press "Cancel" on the
      "ENV:" warnings</li>
      <li>Start the screenmode selector</li>
      <li>Select a standard PAL mode. Save it, reboot and select
      your preferred mode</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OS 3.5/3.9:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy an old Screen mode prefs program from 3.1 to your
      HD, because the new one will not work this way.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>UAE shows a green screen on boot</h2>
    <p>Go to the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU page</a> and select
    JIT -&gt; Force Settings and Indirect Mode or disable JIT
    completely.</p>
    <h2>The folder "displaydrivers"</h2>
    <p>These are the picasso96 UAE drivers. Just ignore the drawer.
    The latest Picasso96 installer has correctly working display
    drivers included.</p>
    <h2>Tips for Tuning or random crashes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have an old HD, install a pure Windows for testing
      purposes. Does the program work?</li>
      <li>Overclock your PC by 10% by using the bus clock. If it
      works correctly your PC seems to be stable. If it works for 4
      minutes, it seems to be stable, too. If it doesn't work, try
      downclock it. Less crashes?</li>
      <li>A problem on non UDMA HD is that PIO4 or SCSI have no
      transfer error detection. So try to let your PC run on PIO3
      (DMA still works) a month or so. The speed loss is not
      measurable in daily use, because Windows normally transfers
      small blocks. Less crashes?</li>
      <li>You can install Sysmon by using the Windows installer.
      With this tool you can see how many kB/s are transferred and
      how much memory a program uses. So you see if the the program
      is slow is related to the memory. Normally the allocated
      memory should not exceed your physical memory by more than 30
      MB. If so, you can increase speed by using more memory.</li>
      <li>Time has shown that large drives are better than drives
      with high RPM. A 9 GB 10000 RPM SCSI drive is slower than a
      40GB 7200 RPM IDE drive, if you use the same partition
      size.</li>
    </ul>
