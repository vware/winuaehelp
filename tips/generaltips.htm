<p class="headline2">Some tips to get happier with WinUAE</p>
<p class="headline3">Adjust the CPU Idle slider to save Money</p>
<p class="text">Modern CPUs save much power when they have nothing to do, for
  example you write a text or work with your workbench hear MP3 music. A AMD64
  CPU in IDLE mode consumes 10 Watts. In full load mode, it uses 83 Watt. A P4
  Prescot with E0 Stepping also has the ability to save a lot of power. A Athlon
  XP must disconnect the system bus. In ost BIOS settings, this option is disabled,
  because old CPUs have bugs in this feature. Y may try and activate it, if your
  system works stable. <br>
  Using the CPU IDLE feature saves you money, allows for lower opterating temperatures,
  and (if your fans are temperature controlled) less noise.</p>
<p class="text">In the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU tab</a> you can choose the
  optimal value for power saving. The CPU must be set to fastest possible in
  A500 mode. You must set the slider so far right, so that the Windows Task Manager
  shows about 10-15% CPU load. If you set it more right, you save more CPU load,
  but WinUAE will run generally slower. But if you are on the road with a notebook
  it may be a good choice to sacrifice speed for longer runtime. You can avoid
  the clock being incorrect using the <a href="amigaprogs.htm">timehack program</a>.</p>

<p class="headline3">Printing with WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">Currently, there are 2 ways to print with WinUAE:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">For the same way as classic a Amiga, you can set a parallel
    printer in the WinUAE settings tab <a href="../gui/ports.htm">Game &amp; I/O
    Ports</a>. Make sure Postscript&nbsp; detection and Post Script Printer Emulation
    are not checked. If you use Windows 2000/XP, set the autoflush timeout to
    2. Now you can save your config and can start WinUAE and do the rest on the
    Amiga. If you use turboprint, do not use the turboprint spooler and chose
    parallel port or turbopar for the print device. If you print something you
    should see an entry in the Windows printer spooler.</li>
  <li class="text">If you have a printer that the Amiga does not support, you
    can choose the Postscript output. For this you need to install GhostScript
    for Windows. In WinUAE, select the printer and check on&nbsp; Postscript&nbsp; detection
    and Post Script Printer Emulation. Note: You can not change these settings
    on the fly (when you press F12 during emulation).<br>
    Boot your emulated Amiga. There is a large probability that turboprint does
    not work with these printer settings, and prints out an empty page instead.<br>
    Remove turbostart if you have it and chose the Workbench Postscript Printer.
    Please note that the OS3.5 and OS3.9 drivers crash when you use greyscale
    or black and white. Choose color instead. Set it on all printer prefs pages.
    You can chose the real output format with the windows printer preferences.<br>
    Note: Most of the time it is enough to use the Workbench printer with 300
    dpi. Higher resolutions may not produce an visible advantage, but definitely
    cost time and space.<br>
    The printer must dither colors, so it is important here to chose 600 or 1200
    dpi on the Windows side.<br>
    If you really want greyscale and Black&amp;White from the Amiga side, use
    the driver from OS3.1 which works. The OS3.5 and OS3.9 driver seem to have
    a compiler Bug, and this function also does not work on real Amigas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">The uae_german keymap does not support µ or € Symbols</p>
<p class="text">Recommend is the use of german_keymap_new.zip and set input other
  then compatibility Mode.This map is perfect compatible.For Euro you need of
  course a character set that support Euro Symbol, but work not in compatibility
  mode.See also the readme of it. Works only on 0.9.90 and above.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using a Mousewheel</p>
<p class="text">This work same as real amiga.Use the tool Freewheel from AmiNet.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">WinUAE does not accept my hardfiles or show only CLI with
  my always used config</p>
<p class="text">This happens if a second instance of WinUAE is running. It is
  not allowed to use the same hardfile with multiple WinUAE sessions at the same
  time. In very rare situations a very bad Amiga program crash could happen and
  prevent WinUAE from releasing the hardfile. So you can not load it in when
  you quit and start WinUAE. In this case, free the handle to the file manually
  or reboot Windows. If WinUAE takes long to boot you can switch on drive LEDs
  in the GUI. If the harddrive LED is on you know the hardfile is valid.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Install OS3.9 when you have a running aiab (fastest way
  to get OS3.9 work)</p>
<p class="text">If you dont have <a href="../links.htm#tools">AIAB</a> it is
  recommended to install it, it is much easier than installing from real Amiga
  emergency floppy.</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Boot from AIAB</li>
  <li class="text">Insert the OS3.9 CD</li>
  <li class="text">Start the OS3.9 Installer and choose "Make emergency floppy"<br>
    The installer will create an emergency floppy with correct CD-ROM support
      and P96 support with correct rtg.library</li>
  <li class="text">Boot from the emergency floppy</li>
  <li class="text">You are ready to install OS3.9</li>
</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>Hint:</strong> If you get CD read errors you need reduce
  the max transfer rate in your CD-ROM driver settings.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">After resuming from hybernate state, the Amiga Clock shows
  the wrong time</p>
<p class="text">Use the <a href="amigaprogs.htm">amiga program</a> timehack.
  This is maybe also useful if you throttled CPU idle too much because time can
  then run 3-10% slower.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How to make custom screen resolutions for WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">Powerstrip works OK now since Version 3.3 and nVidia drivers
  version 40 or later, so please make sure you are using the latest version of
  Powerstrip and nVidia drivers.</p>
<p class="text">Create the modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Change into the menu displayprofile -&gt; configure</li>
  <li class="text">Click advanced timing options -&gt; custom resolutions -&gt; user
    defined</li>
  <li class="text">Set desired values and reboot windows if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It is also possible to create interlaced doublescan resolutions
  in this menu.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How to install OS 3.5 and 3.9 from AN emergency Floppy disk</p>
<p class="text">It is only allowed to either use OS3.5 or 3.9 on 1 Computer at
  the same time. Read the H&amp;P license carefully. Maybe H&amp;P placed a note
  in the license of newer OS3.9 distributions that restricts its use to AmigaHardware.</p>
<p class="text">Here we go:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Insert the emergency floppy in your old Amiga</li>
  <li class="text">Use <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">Transdisk</a> to create
    an ADF and <a href="../started/pcamitrans.htm">transfer</a> it to your PC</li>
  <li class="text">Boot your emulated Amiga with WinUAE and "insert" the ADF
    in a floppy drive </li>
  <li class="text">Open the file devs/dosdrivers/emergency_CD on the disk with
    a texteditor</li>
  <li class="text">Change the line device ="xxxxxx to device ="uaescsi.device"</li>
  <li class="text">Change UnitNum if needed</li>
  <li class="text">Change the text MaxTransfer = xxxxxxx to MaxTransfer =0xffff<br>
    If you get read/write errors from CD use a value of 0x1fff instead</li>
  <li class="text">Save the changed file to disk</li>
  <li class="text">Boot from the emergency disk and make sure the OS3.5/3.9 CD
    is inserted</li>
</ol>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using a real Amiga formatTeD Harddrive in WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">This can be done in the <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">harddrive
    page</a> in the GUI. If there is no drive listed, it is possible that this
    drive has no Amiga/Amithlon Partition. Note that this feature is not available
    in Windows 9x/ME environments.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have several damaged Amigas - can i use the kickstart
  from them?</p>
<p class="text">Follow the instructions on the <a href="../started/transrom.htm">Transrom</a> page.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using other filesystems on Hardfiles (SFS tested)</p>
<p class="text">Create a Hardfile. For use with HDToolbox you must set the Sector
  Surface and Reserved numbers to 0. The volume name should show N/A. Make a
  hdtoolsbox Icon with device=uaehf.device. Now do all steps like with a real
  Amiga with HDToolsBox..</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> The mouse pointer freezes sometimes and I have to reboot</p>
<p class="text">Make sure you have the serial port enabled and correctly configured.
  Also, make sure the "Shared" checkbox is checked to loose no speed.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Differences of CD drivers </p>
<p class="text">AsimCDFS:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Fails if you mount more than 1 CD drive (all devices show
    the same CD content)</li>
  <li class="text">Seems to be a bug in AsimCDFS, because it happens on real
    Amigas as well</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">cacheCDFS:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Set the MaxTransfer size to 0x10000 (65 kb) in the mountfile</li>
  <li class="text">This make cacheCDFS working and not display the read/write
    error Requesters</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> Get UAE working in every dir/drive without changing configs</p>
<p class="text">Make use of relative pathes to realize this.</p>
<p class="text">Example:<br>
  WinUAE is in C:\Amiga\WinUAE, and Kickstart ROMs are in C:\Amiga\Kickstart.<br>
  For the kickstart path, enter ..\Kickstart.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> UAE doesn't boot due to Picasso96 failure (Picasso96 is
  extremely slow)</p>
<p class="text">Start UAE and immediately press both Mousebuttons when the main
  window is shown. In the Amiga Early Startup select "Boot without Startup-Sequence".
  Now remove or move the uaegfx file in devs:monitors. Start UAE, now the Workbench
  shows up. Just select a AmigaMode Save and copy uaegfx to devs/monitors again.
  If this should fail, reinstall Picasso96.</p>
<p class="text">Don't forget to copy the rtg.library file, which can be found
  in the AmigaPrograms directory, to libs:picasso96.This&nbsp; is important for
  full speed of WinUAE.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">A chipset Mode that UAE does not display makes UAE fail</p>
<p class="text">OS 3.1:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Boot without aStartup-Sequence (from Amiga Early Startup menu),
    type loadwb in the CLI, and press "Cancel" on the "ENV:" warnings</li>
  <li class="text">Start the screenmode selector</li>
  <li class="text">Select a standard PAL mode. Save it, reboot and select your
    preferred mode</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"> OS 3.5/3.9:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Copy an old Screenmode prefs program from 3.1 to your HD,
    because the new one will not work this way.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">UAE shows a green screen on boot</p>
<p class="text">Go to the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU page</a> and select <span class="textmenu">JIT
    -&gt; Force Settings</span> and <span class="textmenu">Indirect Mode</span> or
    disable JIT completely.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">The folder "displaydrivers"</p>
<p class="text">These are the picasso96 UAE drivers. Just ignore the drawer.
  The latest Picasso96 installer has correctly working display drivers included.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Tips for Tuning or random crashes</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">If you have an old HD (500MB), install a pure Windows for
    testing purposes. Does the program work?</li>
  <li class="text">Overclock your PC by 10% by using the bus clock. If it works
    correctly your PC seems to be stable. If it works for 4 minutes, it seems
    to be stable, too. If it doesn't work, try downclock it. Less crashes?</li>
  <li class="text">A problem on non UDMA HD is that PIO4 or SCSI have no transfer
    error detection. So try to let your PC run on PIO3 (DMA still works) a month
    or so. The speed loss is not measurable in daily use, because Windows normally
    transfers small blocks. Less crashes?</li>
  <li class="text">You can install Sysmon by using the Windows installer. With
    this tooly you can see how many kB/sec are transferred and how much memory
    a program uses. So you see if the the program is slow is related to the memory.
    Normally the allocated memory should not exceed your physical memory by more
    than 30 MB. If so, you can increase speed by using more memory.</li>
  <li class="text">I found out that, large drives are better than drives with
    high RPM. A 9 GB 10000 RPM SCSI drive is slower than a 40GB 7200 RPM IDE
    drive, if you use the same partition size.</li>
</ul>
