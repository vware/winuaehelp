  <h2>Where can I get the latest UAE?</h2>
  <p>Have a look at our collection of <a href="../links.htm#official">official
    UAE sites</a>.</p>
  <h2>Can a PC read Amiga floppy disks?</h2>
  <p>Yes, if you have two floppy drives and the new <a href="../links.htm#tools">Disk2FDI</a> program
    which will read Amiga Disks and write it to FDI format which is<br />
    compatible with WinUAE.<br />
    For the PC to read Amiga disks directly, extra hardware will need to be purchased
    which can read (or write) Amiga disks easily. The ISA Catweasel floppy controller
    can be used on the PC to read (or write) Amiga disks. Further information is
    available from the web site at <a href="../links.htm#shops">Individual Computers</a>.<br />
    Finally, if these options are not feasible, why not buy a real Amiga second
    hand for those occasions when you want to transfer files and you'll have access
    to a real KS and WB for use on your main machine.</p>
  <h2>What are ADFs, ADZ, LHA, LZX, DMS, ZIP and Z files?</h2>
  <p>An ADF is an image of an Amiga disk, so that the long filenames,
    comments, and flags are kept. The ADFs have to be copied to PC formatted disks
    to be read on the Amiga. ADZ files are GZIP'd ADF files. You need GZIP.EXE
    to access the original ADF files. Keeping them GZIP'd will save space and WinUAE
    can extract them automatically.<br />
    LHA is the common file archive format on the Amiga, Aminet uses it a lot as
    well as DMS (Disk Masher) which is a disk archive format. You can use DMS,
    xDMS or ADFOpus to extract or convert DMS archives to ADF. You need LHA and
    LZX programs to archive or unarchive files. For example, to unarchive a lha
    file, type <em>LHA X GAME.LHA</em> to extract the files to the current directory.
    To make an archive, type <em>LHA A GAME.LHA GameDir/#?</em> which will add
    all files in GameDir to GAME.LHA. To list files, type <em>LHA L GAME.LHA</em>.<br />
    If using LHA on the PC with Amiga lha files, use the <strong>/ax</strong> options
    to allow the files to be extracted properly. LZX is a newer faster and more
    compact archiver than LHA and requires the LZX program to extract them. All
    these unarchivers are available from Aminet. Try the W95 UnLZX program to extract
    LZX files on your PC.<br />
    Amigas can also handle the common ZIP format using the ZIP and UNZIP commands
    (equivalent to PKZIP and PKUNZIP on the PC). The Amiga version of the unix
    GZIP format can handle .Z and .ADZ files.<br />
    You can download all the Amiga (de)archivers from here: Amiga Archivers for
    use within WinUAE or try X-Arc from <a href="../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> for
    use in Workbench.</p>
  <h2>Can I emulate a Hard Disk?</h2>
  <p>Yes, that is possible. You can either specify a directory on
    the PC's hard disk e.g. C:\UAE\AmigaHD or you can specify a hard file. The <br />
    advantage of a directory is that you can copy files directly from the PC site
    into the directory for immediate access by the Emulator. For hard <br />
    files you can use the Amiga's long filenames, file comments and protection
    flags. For a hard disk to be bootable, make sure you copy the whole <br />
    Workbench disk including hidden directories. Some programs work better with
    Hard Files than directories.<br />
    For more information see <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard disk setup</a>.<br />
    WinUAE 0.8.22 or later can read Amiga Formatted hard disks directly via the
    Hard Drives tab on WinUAE. Click on Add Harddrive and it <br />
    will list any connected Amiga harddrives or any empty harddrive space to add
    to WinUAE. On older emulators, you could only access hard <br />
    disks via the AFFS file system on Linux or a third party program such as ADFOpus.<br />
    If using Workbench 1.3, it is now possible to use HardFiles if you copy the
    FastFileSystem file to the WinUAE roms directory first (0.8.22r1 or later).<br />
    The HDF may not be recognised on bootup, in which case, boot off a WB2 or later
    disk to format it, then WB1.3 can then see it.</p>
  <h2>Can I access Amiga CDs via the Emulator?</h2>
  <p>Yes, Amiga CDs use the same filesystem for CDs as the PC i.e.
    ISO9660 except that it uses the Rock Ridge extension for long filenames, PCS
    use<br />
    a filesystem called Joliet for long filenames. CacheCDFS can read all these
    formats. </p>
  <p>There are two ways to access Amiga CD disks: insert the CD into
    your CD drive, on the Hard Drive screen of WinUAE, click 'Add Directory' <br />
    and then enter the volume name of the CD and the drive letter of the CD-ROM
    drive e.g. D: (without the slash). Use the Diskchange &lt;device&gt; <br />
    command in a Shell if you change CDs (type Info for list of devices).</p>
  <p>With WinUAE 0.8.21 or later you can install the CacheCDFS CDROM
    drivers from either AmigaOS3.9 CD or a third party driver such as<br />
    AmiCDFS. You need to enable uaescsi.device on the Misc tab before starting
    WinUAE and enable Logging to determine the Unit<br />
    numbers (see WinUAElog.txt file) for your CDROM drive. When you install the
    drive make sure the device is uaescsi.device and the unit numbers <br />
    match the unit numbers in the log file.</p>
  <p>Example if you have only an IDE controller:</p>
  <p> 0=Primary Master<br />
    1=Secondary Master</p>
  <p>When you use WinXP, it is best to switch off &quot;Use ASPI Scsi Layer&quot; the <a href="../gui/misc.htm">Misc
    settings</a> page. Only activate it if you notice problems without it.</p>
  <h2>What limitations can I expect from using WinUAE?</h2>
  <p>An emulator can not fully emulate everything on the Amiga as
    it has to emulate the CPU and the Custom Chipset and all other special hardware.
    The latest versions of WinUAE will try to use buffers for sound to improve
    output and JIT for extra CPU speed, chipset graphics is improving but 256 colours
    can be very slow due to the Amiga's bitmap system of using multiple layers.
    Using Picasso96 emulation can improve graphics a lot, use that wherever possible.<br />
    Emulators are improved all the time, so keep an eye out for new versions. Sound
    emulation can depend on your processor as well, turning it off will improve
    emulation speed though.<br />
    It can not use the MMU on higher 680x0 processors. This means that programs
    that require Memory Management such as Linux or Virtual Memory will not work
    in WinUAE.</p>
  <h2>How do I create a blank disk for saving files or games?</h2>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../gui/floppies.htm">floppies tab</a> and click the button &quot;Create
    Standard Floppy&quot; for use in Workbench or use &quot;Create Custom Floppy&quot; for some
    games to save files to.<br />
    For specific save game disks visit <a href="../links.htm#help">Back2Roots</a>.</p>
  <h2>I have all my floppy drives full, how do I change disks?</h2>
  <p>Press END key and either F1, F2, F3, F4 to do a disk change.<br />
    Using SHIFT+END and F1-F4 will eject the disk.<br />
    You can also press F12 for the setup screen and select Floppy to change the
    disk while its running.</p>
  <h2> How do I save the current &quot;State&quot; of a game?</h2>
  <p>On WinUAE 0.8.17 or later you can now save the current state
    by pressing F12, go to the Misc screen and click 'Save current state'<br />
    which will save the state as a .USS file. Use 'Load a save-state snapshot'
    to load state file. You will need as much disk space as<br />
    memory allocated to the Amiga.</p>
  <h2>Why should I buy Amiga Forever CD or AF Online?</h2>
  <p>Unless you have access to a real Amiga, or have bought a Kickstart
    and Workbench disks, there is no other legal way of getting the OS for your
    emulation. The software is the property of Amiga Inc and only they can licence
    it to companies. Cloanto, have a licence, to distribute Amiga Emulation with
    Kickstart ROM files and Workbench images from CD or from their web site. The
    CD also includes some popular Amiga Software, a complete Workbench hard disk
    setup, MPEG videos of Jay Miner's speech and the Deathbed Vigil (last days
    of Commodore), Amiga Explorer network program etc.You can also boot from the
    CD direct into the Emulator without the need of a host OS using KX Light.<br />
    <br />
    For easy access you can download the online version for as little as $20, you
    get Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 and 3.0, PPaint 7.1, an easy setup menu system,
    Amiga Explorer and the Emulation programs themselves. These would cost a lot
    more if bought seperately. For beginners, it is ideal to set up an Amiga on
    your PC within minutes than having to search the web for them and fiddle with
    setups to get it to work!<br />
    To check it out and get your copy visit <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Amiga
    Forever</a>.</p>
  <h2>Can I access the Internet through WinUAE?</h2>
  <p>That is possible. You can through the PC's Internet connection
    by enabling the <strong>BSD socket library support</strong> feature on the
    MISC page of WinUAE configuration. Make sure you go on line before loading
    WinUAE.</p>
  <h2>How can I make or see inside ADF files without using an
    emulator?</h2>
  <p>You need ADFOpus or ADFView which will allow you to create and
    explore and manipulate the contents of Amiga Disk Format images easily. ADFOpus
    also features a DMS-ADF-ADZ image converter as well. Both tools can be found
    in our <a href="../links.htm#tools">links section</a>.</p>
  <h2>Why does my program / game not work correctly?</h2>
  <p>First make sure your UAE configuration matches the game's requirements.
    Very old games depend on specific versions of Kickstart, processor and memory.
    See <a href="../started/examples.htm">Example Configurations</a> for a list
    of the most common Amiga configurations. If you still
    have problems then download a patch from the <a href="../links.htm#help">Patch &amp; HD
    Installers Page</a> or <a href="../links.htm#tools">WHDLoad</a>, which can
    degrade the Amiga to such a state that the program will run correctly. You
    will probably need to get the latest AmigaOS Installer from <a href="../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> to
    install these tools.<br />
    Also, try using Fellow or <a href="../links.htm#emulators">WinFellow</a> as
    an alternative emulator to run the game.</p>
  <h2>I have installed Windows XP Home Edition but WinUAE now
    crashes?</h2>
  <p>It is recommended that you download the latest version of WinUAE
    from the official <a href="../links.htm#official">homepage</a>. This is especially
    important for users of AmigaForever 4, where the setup will crash.</p>
  <p>You need to run older versions of WinUAE in Compatibility Mode.
    Find WinUAE.exe and select it, press right mouse button and select <strong>Properties</strong>,
    select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and change the Compatibility mode
    to <strong>Windows 98/Windows Me</strong> and tick 'Disable Windows themes'.
    WinUAE should now load.</p>
  <h2>Where can I download a good Workbench set up with useful
    programs?</h2>
  <p>Get Amiga In a Box from <a href="../links.htm#tools">AIAB</a> which
    includes Scalos (Workbench replacement), MUI 3.8, Picasso96, NewIcons, VisualPrefs,
    MCP, MUI tools and Screentab. There are addons for Music, Internet, Languages
    and Shapeshifter.</p>
  <h2>When I run WinUAE, I get an error DINPUT8.DLL not found?</h2>
  <p>You need <a href="../links.htm#essential">DirectX 8</a> or later
    installed. Run DXDiag.exe to see what version you have installed.</p>
  <p>A chart of DirectX versions that ship with supported versions of Windows:</p>

  <h2>How do I create a bootable floppy (real or ADF)?</h2>
  <p>Boot off your Workbench disk, insert a floppy disk in DF1:, open
    a command Shell and type <strong>Install DF1:</strong> which will copy the
    book block on to the disk. Then type <strong>MakeDir DF1:S</strong> to create
    the Script directory. Copy your program file(s) on the disk, preferably root
    or use directories if you wanted to. Then change directory to DF1:S and type <strong>Ed
    Startup-sequence</strong> and type in commands to load your program, usually
    just the name of the Program file will do. Test the disk, by inserting the
    disk into DF0: and Reboot the Amiga.</p>
  <h2>I have a Workbench disk but no Install disk, how do I install
    Workbench?</h2>
  <p>You can download UAEInstall.adf disk which has some AmigaDOS
    or Installer scripts to install Workbench for most Workbench versions including
    1.3 to 3.1.<br />
    If you have the AmigaOS 3.9 CDROM, you can boot from the \Emergency-boot folder via the Hard Drives, Add Directory option.<br />
  For AmigaOS 4.1 Final Edition, you need to follow these <a href="http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=74776">instructions</a>. </p>
  <h2>Is there an emulator for the AmigaOne or PPC processor?</h2>
  <p>There is a Classic Amiga emulator for the AmigaOne that comes
    with AmigaOS 4. There is a PPC emulator for x86 systems from <a href="../links.htm#emulators">PearPC</a>.</p>
