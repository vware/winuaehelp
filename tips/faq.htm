    <h1>Where can I get the latest UAE?</h1>
    <p>Have a look at our collection of <a href=
    "../links.htm#official">official UAE sites</a>.</p>
    <h1>Can a PC read Amiga floppy disks?</h1>
    <p>Yes, if you have two floppy drives and the new <a href=
    "../links.htm#tools">Disk2FDI</a> program which will read Amiga
    Disks and write it to FDI format which is compatible with
    WinUAE.<br>
    For the PC to read Amiga disks directly, extra hardware will
    need to be purchased which can read (or write) Amiga disks
    easily. The ISA Catweasel floppy controller can be used on the
    PC to read (or write) Amiga disks. Further information is
    available from the web site at <a href=
    "../links.htm#shops">Individual Computers</a>.</p>
    <h1>How can I troubleshoot AmigaOS startup?</h1>
    <p>Start UAE and immediately press both mouse buttons when the
    main window is shown. In the Amiga Early Startup select "Boot
    without Startup-Sequence", try disabling drivers or settings
    that may cause the problem.</p>
    <h1>What are ADFs, ADZ, LHA, LZX, DMS, ZIP and Z files?</h1>
    <p>Compression or disk image file formats. Please check our
    <a href="../glossary.htm">Glossary</a> for explanations of
    these acronyms.<br>
    You can download all the Amiga (de)archivers from here: Amiga
    Archivers for use within WinUAE or try X-Arc from <a href=
    "../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> for use in Workbench.</p>
    <h1>Can I emulate a Hard Disk?</h1>
    <p>Yes, that is possible. You can either specify a directory on
    the PC's hard disk e.g. C:\UAE\AmigaHD or you can specify a
    hard file. The advantage of a directory is that you can copy
    files directly from the PC site into the directory for
    immediate access by the Emulator. For hardfiles you can use the
    Amiga's long filenames, file comments and protection flags. For
    a hard disk to be bootable, make sure you copy the whole
    Workbench disk including hidden directories. Some programs work
    better with Hard Files than directories.<br>
    For more information see <a href="../gui/harddrives.htm">Hard
    Disk</a> page.<br>
    If using Workbench 1.3, it is now possible to use HardFiles if
    you copy the FastFileSystem file to the WinUAE ROMs directory
    first (0.8.22r1 or later).<br>
    The HDF may not be recognized on boot, in which case, boot off
    a WB2 or later disk to format it, then WB1.3 can then see
    it.</p>
    <h1>Why does the uae_german keymap not support µ or €
    Symbols?</h1>
    <p>Recommended is the use of german_keymap_new.zip and input
    set to anything other than compatibility mode.</p>
    <h1>What are the differences of CD drivers?</h1>
    <p>AsimCDFS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fails if you mount more than 1 CD drive (all devices show
      the same CD content)</li>
      <li>Seems to be a bug in AsimCDFS, because it happens on real
      Amigas as well</li>
    </ul>
    <p>cacheCDFS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set the MaxTransfer size to 0x10000 (65 kb) in the
      mountfile</li>
      <li>This make cacheCDFS working and not display the
      read/write error Requesters</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Why does WinUAE not accept my hardfiles or show only CLI
    with my standard configuration?</h1>
    <p>This happens if a another instance of WinUAE is running. It
    is not allowed to use the same hardfile with multiple WinUAE
    sessions at the same time. In very rare situations a crash
    could happen and prevent WinUAE from releasing the hardfile. In
    this case, free the file manually or reboot Windows. If WinUAE
    takes long to boot you can switch on drive LEDs in the GUI. If
    the hard drive LED is on you know the hardfile is valid.</p>
    <h1>I have several damaged Amigas - can i use the Kickstart
    from them?</h1>
    <p>Follow the instructions on the <a href=
    "../started/transrom.htm">Transrom</a> page.</p>
    <h1>After resuming from hibernation, the Amiga clock shows the
    wrong time?</h1>
    <p>Use the Amiga program <a href="amigaprogs.htm">timehack</a>
    to fix this.</p>
    <h1>Can I use native Amiga Hard Disks with WinUAE?</h1>
    <p>WinUAE 0.8.22 or later can read Amiga Formatted hard disks
    directly via the Hard Drives tab on WinUAE. Click on Add Hard
    Drive and it will list any connected Amiga hard drives or any
    empty hard drive space to add to WinUAE. On older emulators,
    you could only access hard disks via the AFFS file system on
    Linux or a third party program such as ADFOpus.</p>
    <h1>Can I access Amiga CDs via the Emulator?</h1>
    <p>Yes, Amiga CDs use the same file system for CDs as the PC
    i.e. ISO9660 except that it uses the Rock Ridge extension for
    long filenames, PCS use a file system called Joliet for long
    filenames. CacheCDFS can read all these formats.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to access Amiga CDs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On the Hard Drive screen of WinUAE, click 'Add Directory'
      and then enter the volume name of the CD and the drive letter
      of the CD-ROM drive e.g. D: (without the slash). Use the
      Diskchange &lt;device&gt; command in a Shell if you change
      CDs (type Info for list of devices).</li>
      <li>You can install the CacheCDFS CD-ROM drivers from either
      AmigaOS3.9 CD or a third party driver such as AmiCDFS. You
      need to enable uaescsi.device on the Misc tab before starting
      WinUAE and enable Logging to determine the Unit numbers (see
      WinUAElog.txt file) for your CD-ROM drive. When you install
      the drive make sure the device is uaescsi.device and the unit
      numbers match the unit numbers in the log file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What limitations can I expect from using WinUAE?</h1>
    <p>Depending on your hardware and operating system, none,
    really. WinUAE exceeds the capabilities of most hardware
    Amigas.</p>
    <h1>Can I use the mouse wheel?</h1>
    <p>Yes, but like on a real Amiga, you need the tool Freewheel
    from AmiNet.</p>
    <h1>How do I create a blank disk for saving files or
    games?</h1>
    <p>Go to the <a href="../gui/floppies.htm">floppies tab</a> and
    click the button "Create Standard Floppy" for use in Workbench
    or use "Create Custom Floppy" for some games to save files
    to.<br>
    For specific save game disks visit <a href=
    "../links.htm#help">Back2Roots</a>.</p>
    <h1>I have all my floppy drives full, how do I change
    disks?</h1>
    <p>Press END key and either F1, F2, F3, F4 to do a disk
    change.<br>
    Using SHIFT+END and F1-F4 will eject the disk.<br>
    You can also press F12 for the setup screen and select Floppy
    to change the disk while its running.</p>
    <h1>How do I save the current "State" of a game?</h1>
    <p>On WinUAE 0.8.17 or later you can now save the current state
    by pressing F12, go to the Misc screen and click 'Save current
    state' which will save the state as a .USS file. Use 'Load a
    save-state snapshot' to load state file. You will need as much
    disk space as memory allocated to the Amiga.</p>
    <h1>Why should I buy Amiga Forever CD or AF Online?</h1>
    <p>Unless you have access to a real Amiga, or have bought a
    Kickstart and Workbench disks, there is no other legal way of
    getting the OS for your emulation. The software is the property
    of Amiga Inc and only they can license it to companies.
    Cloanto, have a license, to distribute Amiga Emulation with
    Kickstart ROM files and Workbench images from CD or from their
    web site. The CD also includes some popular Amiga Software, a
    complete Workbench hard disk setup, MPEG videos of Jay Miner's
    speech and the Deathbed Vigil (last days of Commodore), Amiga
    Explorer network program etc.You can also boot from the CD
    direct into the Emulator without the need of a host OS using KX
    Light.<br>
    <br>
    For easy access, you can download the online version for as
    little as $20, you get Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 and 3.0,
    PPaint 7.1, an easy setup menu system, Amiga Explorer and the
    Emulation programs themselves. These would cost a lot more if
    bought separately. For beginners, it is ideal to set up an
    Amiga on your PC within minutes than having to search the web
    for them and fiddle with setups to get it to work!<br>
    To check it out and get your copy visit <a href=
    "../links.htm#allinone">Amiga Forever</a>.</p>
    <h1>Can I access the Internet through WinUAE?</h1>
    <p>Yes, you can through the PC's Internet connection by
    enabling the <strong>BSD socket library support</strong>
    feature on the <a href="../gui/misc.htm">Misc</a> page in
    configuration.</p>
    <h1>How can I make or see inside ADF files without using an
    emulator?</h1>
    <p>You need ADFOpus or ADFView which will allow you to create
    and explore and manipulate the contents of Amiga Disk Format
    images easily. ADFOpus also features a DMS-ADF-ADZ image
    converter as well. Both tools can be found in our <a href=
    "../links.htm#tools">links section</a>.</p>
    <h1>Why does my program / game not work correctly?</h1>
    <p>First make sure your UAE configuration matches the game's
    requirements. Very old games depend on specific versions of
    Kickstart, processor and memory. See <a href=
    "../started/examples.htm">Example Configurations</a> for a list
    of the most common Amiga configurations. If you still have
    problems then download a patch from the <a href=
    "../links.htm#help">Patch & HD Installers Page</a> or <a href=
    "../links.htm#tools">WHDLoad</a>, which can degrade the Amiga
    to such a state that the program will run correctly. You will
    probably need to get the latest AmigaOS Installer from <a href=
    "../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> to install these tools.</p>
    <h1>Why does WinUAE crash on Windows XP Home?</h1>
    <p>This only happens in ancient versions, it is recommended
    that you download the latest version of WinUAE from the
    official <a href="../links.htm#official">homepage</a>. This is
    especially important for users of AmigaForever 4, where the
    setup will crash.</p>
    <h1>Where can I download a good Workbench set up with useful
    programs?</h1>
    <p>Get Amiga In a Box from <a href=
    "../links.htm#tools">AIAB</a> which includes Scalos (Workbench
    replacement), MUI 3.8, Picasso96, NewIcons, VisualPrefs, MCP,
    MUI tools and Screentab. There are add-ons for Music, Internet,
    Languages and Shapeshifter.</p>
    <h1>When I run WinUAE, I get an error DINPUT8.DLL not
    found?</h1>
    <p>Please update your OS and WinUAE. If you are intentionally
    trying to run a old WinUAE version on an outdated Windows, you
    need DirectX 8 or later installed. Run DXDiag.exe to see what
    version you have installed.</p>
    <h1>How do I create a bootable floppy (real or ADF)?</h1>
    <p>There is a dedicated <a href="bootdisk.htm">guide</a> for
    this.</p>
    <h1>I have a Workbench disk but no Install disk, how do I
    install Workbench?</h1>
    <p>You can download UAEInstall.adf disk which has some AmigaDOS
    or Installer scripts to install Workbench for most Workbench
    versions including 1.3 to 3.1.<br>
    If you have the AmigaOS 3.9 CD-ROM, you can boot from the
    \Emergency-boot folder via the Hard Drives, Add Directory
    option.<br>
    For AmigaOS 4.1 Final Edition, you can find instructions
    online.</p>
    <h1>Is there an emulator for the AmigaOne or PPC
    processor?</h1>
    <p>There is a Classic Amiga emulator for the AmigaOne that
    comes with AmigaOS 4. There is a PPC emulator for x86 systems
    from <a href="../links.htm#emulators">PearPC</a>.</p>
    <h1>What is the folder "displaydrivers" for?</h1>
    <p>These are the picasso96 UAE drivers. It is usually safe to
    ignore the drawer. The latest Picasso96 installer has working
    display drivers included.</p>
