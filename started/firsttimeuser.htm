<p class="headline1">WinUAE for First Time Users</p>
<p class="text">Several Amiga models have been released over the years, hence
  the complexity of WinUAE, it can emulate everthing from the first A1000 right
  up to the A4000 with the popular A500 and A1200 in between. So you need to
  know a little about how to configure WinUAE to emulate an Amiga model with
  their small variations in specifications such as memory, CPU, custom chipset,
  and so on.</p>
<p class="text">This page will give you a quick overview how to get your first
  installation up and running. </p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Double click WinUAE to run it.</li>
  <li class="text">The first screen is the Quickstart section, where WinUAE offers
    you an extremely easy way to configure your emulated Amiga. Just select the
    desired Amiga model you have a <a href="../background/kickst.htm">Kickstart
    ROM</a> for. For your convenience, a comparison table of popular Amiga models
    is available at the <a href="examples.htm">Examples</a> page.</li>
  <li class="text"> Programs and games are usually distributed on 880k floppy
    disks in an incompatible format called OFS (Original File System) or FFS
    (Fast File System), which PC's cannot read directly. So, these disks are
    copied into a file called an ADF (Amiga Disk Format), on some emulators these
    are called 'ROMs'. To load an ADF disk, click on <a href="../gui/floppies.htm">Disk
    Drives</a> tab. Then click on the elipses ( ... ) opposite DF0 and select
    an ADF file from either your hard disk or other location.</li>
  <li class="text"> If a game came on multiple disks, you can insert them into
    further floppy drives, named DF1, DF2 and DF3. Note that a few games assume
    there is only one floppy drive (DF0) and will only look there. If while playing
    a game you need to change disks, press <strong>F12</strong> to load the WinUAE
    GUI and click on Floppies, select <strong>Eject</strong> next to floppy drive
    and load the next disk. Alternatively, press END and F1, F2, F3 or F4 to
    change a disk in DF0-DF3.</li>
  <li><span class="text"> Amigas can also use <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard
        Drives</a> like the PC, you can either use a normal directory on a PC
        hard disk to store Amiga files or you can use a HardFile, which is one
        big file that stores all the Amiga files together. You can also use real
        Amiga formatted disks as well. To access data on PC volumes, tick <strong>Add
        PC Drives at Startup</strong>. </span>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">To set up a Directory, click Hard Drives, click Add Directory,
        then give the disk a device name e.g. DH0, a volume name e.g. System
        and the location of the directory e.g. C:\AmigaForever\System for example.</li>
      <li class="text">To set up a Hard File, click Hard Drives, click Add Hardfile,
        under <strong>New Hard File, </strong>enter the size of the Hard file
        in Megabytes, anything from 10MB to 2GB is possible, click on <strong>Create, </strong>select
        the location and name of the hard file and click <strong>Save</strong>.
        You can load an existing hard file via the <strong>Path</strong> ...
        button.</li>
      <li class="text">If you have a real Amiga Hard Disk, and it is connected
        directly to your PC, you can select it from a list via the <strong>Add
        Harddrive</strong> button.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="text">To set up a CDROM drive for access via WinUAE, click on the <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/misc.htm">Misc</a> tab
    and enable the <strong>UAEscsi.device</strong>, when you load up Workbench,
    you need to install an Amiga compatible CDROM filesystem such as CacheCDFS,
    AmiCDFS, IDEFix and so on. The device name for the <strong>CD0</strong> DosDriver
    should be UAEscsi.device and the unit number is usually 0 or 1 (if unsure, <strong>enable
    logging</strong> on the Misc page and start WinUAE to create a log file and
    it will tell you what your CDROM unit numbers are), see the Icon Information
    and change the tooltypes to change these values.</li>
  <li class="text"> When your configuration is complete, click the <strong>Start</strong> button
    to start the emulation. If no hard disk or bootable floppy is found, you
    may see the Insert Disk screen, press F12 and click on Floppies to change
    the disk and click OK to restart. If the emulation crashes or fails to boot,
    press F12, goto Misc screen and click <strong>Reset Amiga</strong> and then
    OK.</li>
  <li class="text"> When finished with the emulation you can press <strong>Ctrl+F11, </strong>close
    the window, or press F12 and click Quit on the <a href="../gui/misc.htm">Misc</a> tab.</li>
