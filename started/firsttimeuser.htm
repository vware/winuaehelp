    <p>Several Amiga models have been released over the years,
    hence the complexity of WinUAE, it can emulate everthing from
    the first A1000 right up to the A4000 with the popular A500 and
    A1200 in between. So you need to know a little about how to
    configure WinUAE to emulate an Amiga model with their small
    variations in specifications such as memory, CPU, custom
    chipset, and so on.</p>
    <p>This page will give you a quick overview how to get your
    first installation up and running:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Double click WinUAE to run it.</li>
      <li>The first screen is the Quickstart section, where WinUAE
      offers you an extremely easy way to configure your emulated
      Amiga. Just select the desired Amiga model you have a
        <a href="../background/kickst.htm">Kickstart ROM</a> for.
        For your convenience, a comparison table of popular Amiga
        models is available at the <a href="examples.htm">Examples
        page</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Programs and games are usually distributed on 880k floppy
      disks in an incompatible format called OFS (Original File
      System) or FFS (Fast File System), which PC's cannot read
      directly. So, these disks are copied into a file called an
      ADF (Amiga Disk Format), on some emulators these are called
      'ROMs'. To load an ADF disk, click on <a href=
      "../gui/floppies.htm">Floppy Drives</a> tab. Then click on
      the elipses ( ... ) opposite DF0 and select an ADF file from
      either your hard disk or other location.
      </li>
      <li>If a game came on multiple disks, you can insert them
      into further floppy drives, named DF1, DF2 and DF3. Note that
      a few games assume there is only one floppy drive (DF0) and
      will only look there. If while playing a game you need to
      change disks, press <strong>F12</strong> to load the WinUAE
      GUI and click on Floppies, select <strong>Eject</strong> next
      to floppy drive and load the next disk. Alternatively, press
      END and F1, F2, F3 or F4 to change a disk in DF0-DF3.</li>
      <li>Amigas can also use <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard
      Drives</a> like the PC, you can either use a normal directory
      on a PC hard disk to store Amiga files or you can use a
      HardFile, which is one big file that stores all the Amiga
      files together. You can also use real Amiga formatted disks
      as well. To access data on PC volumes, tick <strong>Add PC
      Drives at Startup</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li>To set up a Directory, click Hard Drives, click Add
          Directory, then give the disk a device name e.g. DH0, a
          volume name e.g. System and the location of the directory
          e.g. C:\AmigaForever\System for example.</li>
          <li>To set up a Hard File, click Hard Drives, click Add
          Hardfile, under <strong>New Hard File,</strong> enter the
          size of the Hard file in Megabytes, anything from 10MB to
          2GB is possible, click on <strong>Create,</strong> select
          the location and name of the hard file and click
          <strong>Save</strong>. You can load an existing hard file
          via the <strong>Path</strong> ... button.</li>
          <li>If you have a real Amiga Hard Disk, and it is
          connected directly to your PC, you can select it from a
          list via the <strong>Add Harddrive</strong> button.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To set up a CDROM drive for access via WinUAE, click on
      the <a href="../gui/misc.htm">Expansions</a> tab and enable
      the <strong>uaescsi.device</strong>, when you load up
      Workbench, you need to install an Amiga compatible CDROM
      filesystem such as CacheCDFS, AmiCDFS, IDEFix and so on. The
      device name for the <strong>CD0</strong> DosDriver should be
      UAEscsi.device and the unit number is usually 0 or 1 (if
      unsure, enable <strong>Create Log file</strong> on the
      Miscellaneous page and start WinUAE to create a log file and
      it will tell you what your CDROM unit numbers are), see the
      Icon Information and change the tooltypes to change these
      values.
      </li>
      <li>When your configuration is complete, click the
      <strong>Start</strong> button to start the emulation. If no
      hard disk or bootable floppy is found, you may see the Insert
      Disk screen, press F12 and click on Floppies to change the
      disk and click OK to restart. If the emulation crashes or
      fails to boot, press F12, goto Misc screen and click
      <strong>Reset Amiga</strong> and then OK.</li>
      <li>When finished with the emulation you can press
      <strong>Ctrl+F11,</strong> close the window, or press F12 and
      click <strong>Quit</strong> on the bottom left of the
      window.</li>
