<p class="headline1">WinUAE for First Time Users</p>
<p class="text">Hello and welcome to the Umbiquious Amiga Emulator for Windows
  (WinUAE). The Amiga computer was a popular home computer from 1984-1994 by
  Commodore Business Machines (CBM), which competed directly with the Atari ST,
  Archimedes, IBM PC compatibles and other computers at the time. The Amiga was
  based on the Motorola 680x0 series of processors, had its own custom chipset
  for graphics and sound (since there weren't that many good graphics chips around
  then) and ran its own operating system: AmigaOS with a Graphical User Interface
  (GUI) called Workbench.</p>
<p class="text">There is no one model of Amiga but several, hence the complexity
  of WinUAE, it can emulate everthing from the first A1000 right up to the A4000
  with the popular A500 and A1200 in between. So you need a little about how
  to configure WinUAE to emulate an Amiga model with their small variations in
  specification such as memory, cpus, custom chipsets and so on.</p>
<p class="text">1. Double click WinUAE to run it.</p>
<p class="text">2. The first screen is the <a href="file:///D|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/configurations.htm">Configuration</a> section,
  there will probably no configurations set up, so you need to create one. To
  help you, I have a table of popular Amiga models you can emulate on the <a href="examples.htm">Examples</a> page.
  You will need to set up Chipset, CPU and RAM and ROM pages in particular to
  match the Amiga to emulate.</p>
<p class="text">3. Programs and games are usually distributed on 880K floppy
  disks in an incompatible format called OFS (Original Filing System) or FFS
  (Fast Filing System), which PC's cannot read directly. So, these disks are
  copied into a file called an ADF (Amiga Disk Format), on some emulators these
  are called 'ROMs'. To load an ADF disk, click on the <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/floppies.htm">Disk
  Drives </a> tab. Then click on the elipses ( ... ) opposite DF0 and select
  an ADF file from either your hard disk or other location. </p>
<p class="text">4. If a game, came on multiple disks, you can insert them into
  further floppy drives, named DF1, DF2 and DF3. Note that a few games assume
  there is only one floppy drive (DF0) and will only look there. So watch out.
  If while playing a game and you need to change disks, press <strong>F12</strong> to
  load the WinUAE GUI and click on Floppies, select <strong>Eject</strong> next
  to floppy drive and load the next disk. Alternatively, press END and F1, F2,
  F3 or F4 to change a disk in DF0-DF3.</p>
<p class="text">5. Amigas can also use <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard
    Drives</a> like the PC, you can either use a normal directory on a PC hard
    disk to store Amiga files or you can use a HardFile, which is one big file
    that stores all the Amiga files together. You can also use real Amiga formatted
    disks as well. To access data on PC volumes, tick <strong>Add PC Drives at
    Startup.</strong><br>
  <br>
  a) To set up a Directory, click Hard Drives, click Add Directory, then give
  the disk a device name e.g. DH0, a volume name e.g. System and the location
  of the directory e.g. c:\AmigaForever\System for example.</p>
<p class="text">b) To set up a Hard File, click Hard Drives, click Add Hardfile,
  under <strong>New Hard File, </strong>enter the size of the Hard file in Megabytes,
  anything from 10MB to 2GB is possible, click on <strong>Create, </strong>select
  the location and name of the hard file and click <strong>Save</strong>. You
  can load an existing hard file via the <strong>Path</strong> ... button.</p>
<p class="text">c) If you have a real Amiga Hard Disk, and it is connected directly
  to your PC, you can select it from a list via the <strong>Add Harddrive</strong> button.</p>
<p class="text">6. To set up a CDROM drive for access via WinUAE, click on the <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/misc.htm">Misc</a> tab
  and enable the <strong>UAEscsi.device</strong>, when you load up Workbench,
  you need to install an Amiga compatible CDROM filesystem such as CacheCDFS,
  AmiCDFS, IDEFix and so on. The device name for the <strong>CD0</strong> DosDriver
  should be UAEscsi.device and the unit number is usually 0 or 1 (if unsure, <strong>enable
  logging</strong> on the Misc page and start WinUAE to create a log file and
  it will tell you what your CDROM unit numbers are), see the Icon Information
  and change the tooltypes to change these values.</p>
<p class="text">7. When your configuration is complete, click the <strong>OK</strong> button
  to start the emulation. If no hard disk or bootable floppy is found, you may
  see the Insert Disk screen, press F12 and click on Floppies to change the disk
  and click OK to restart. If the emulation crashes or fails to boot, press F12,
  goto Misc screen and click <strong>Reset Amiga</strong> and then OK. </p>
<p class="text">8. When finished with the emulation you can press <strong>Ctrl+F11, </strong>close
  the Window, or press F12 and click Quit on the Misc tab.</p>
