<p class="text">Since the PC floppy controller can't read Amiga disks, floppy
  access has to be emulated differently: Floppies are emulated by means of disk
  files that contain a raw image of the floppy disk you want to emulate. They
  can be created with <a href="transdisk.htm">transdisk</a>.</p>
<p class="text">To actually run anything in UAE, you will need to install a Amiga
  Kickstart ROM image from an Amiga. You can't run UAE if you don't have this
  image. It is not included because it is copyrighted software. It has to be
  created with <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a>.</p>
<p class="text">In the &quot;Amiga Programs&quot; subdirectory you will find
  the two small Amiga programs that will help you generate the necessary image
  files. After you copied the tools to your Amiga, open the CLI. Refer to the
  transrom &amp; transdisk pages for further information. <strong>NEVER</strong> run
  either of these programs from the Workbench! Always open a Shell or CLI window
  to do this.</p>
<p class="text">UAE needs a Kickstart ROM file and a bootable disk image in order
  to boot the emulated Amiga. Disks can be inserted using the <a href="../gui/floppies.htm">Floppies</a> tab
  in the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a>. UAE has to be configured to use a &quot;Kickstart
  ROM&quot; in the <a href="../gui/rom.htm">ROM</a> tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you transfer commercial software, you
  must not distribute the resulting image files, since that would be a violation
  of copyright law. The Kickstart ROM has to be considered commercial software.
  You may only use the Kickstart from your own Amiga, and you may not distribute
  Kickstart ROM files. Please read the license that came with your software for
  details.</p>
