  <p>Since the PC floppy controller can't read Amiga disks, floppy
    access has to be emulated differently: Floppies are emulated by means of disk
    files that contain a raw image of the floppy disk you want to emulate. They
    can be created with <a href="transdisk.htm">transdisk</a>.</p>
  <p>As mentioned in the <a href="legal.htm">Legal Notes</a>, you
    can not use WinUAE without an Amiga Kickstart ROM image. However, you can create
    on from your real Amiga using <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a>.</p>
  <p>In the &quot;Amiga Programs&quot; subdirectory you will find
    the two small Amiga programs that will help you generate the necessary image
    files. After you copied the tools to your Amiga, open the CLI. Refer to the
    transrom &amp; transdisk pages for further information. <strong>NEVER</strong> run
    either of these programs from the Workbench! Always open a Shell or CLI window
    to do this.</p>
  <p>UAE needs a Kickstart ROM file and a bootable disk image in order
    to boot the emulated Amiga. Disks can be inserted using the <a href="../gui/floppies.htm">Floppies</a> tab
    in the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a>. UAE has to be configured to use a &quot;Kickstart
    ROM&quot; in the <a href="../gui/rom.htm">ROM</a> tab.</p>
