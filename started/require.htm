    <p>WinUAE requires DirectX 8 or later, so on Windows 2000, you
    may need to install a more recent DirectX runtime. Select
    Start, Run and enter DXDIAG to see what version you have
    installed.</p>
    <p>WinUAE no longer supports Windows 9x/NT4. If you need
    support for such an outdated operating system, WinUAE 0.8.8
    still supports Windows NT 4.0 (see
    <strong>winuae-compat.exe</strong>). If short on memory or CPU,
    please use <strong>winuae-mini.exe</strong> (0.8.22r8).</p>
    <p>Also, WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work
    properly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kickstart, a ROM chip which contains essential parts
      of the Operating System and an Amiga can not boot without
      it.<br>
        A copy of your Kickstart ROM (sometimes referred as a
        ROM-image, ROM-file, KickFile, or KickROM) into a file
        called kick.rom. If you own an Amiga, you can extract a
        ROM-image using the included <a href=
        "transrom.htm">transrom</a> utility, which must be run on
        your Amiga.<br>
        If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy
        of a Kickstart ROM from <a href=
        "../credits/about.htm">Amiga Forever</a> software package.
        Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga
        Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ROM</em>. If
        you have the <strong>Amiga Classix CD</strong>, you can
        find a Kickstart 1.3 ROM file on it.
      </li>
      <li>The Workbench, which is the Amiga's User Interface to
      manage files and start applications, in other terms
      AmigaOS.<br>
        If you own an Amiga, you can transfer your Workbench disks
        to the .adf file-format used by UAE by running the included
        <a href="transdisk.htm">Transdisk</a> utility. Again, this
        must be run on your Amiga. If you no longer own an Amiga,
        you can obtain a legal copy of various Amiga OS releases
        from the Amiga Forever software package.<br>
        A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on
        the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in
        <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench
        directory hard disk set up in
        <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
        Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5</strong> or
        <strong>3.9</strong> CD can be purchased from any good
        <a href="../links.htm#shops">Amiga dealer</a> and can be
        read directly on a PC as a Read Only Directory based Hard
        Disk on WinUAE.<br>
        If you have WB 2.0 or better, try ADF Blitzer, which has a
        nice Workbench front end!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are done with creating the necessary files on your
    Amiga, have a look at the <a href="pcamitrans.htm">Data
    Transfer Amiga &lt;-&gt; PC</a> page.</p>
    <p>Lastly, please keep in mind that WinUAE is a fairly hungry
    application and requires a lot of computing power to accurately
    emulate the Amiga. The following system is recommended before
    running WinUAE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pentium IV 2GHz (or better)</li>
      <li>512MB of RAM</li>
      <li>Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8 with DirectX 8.0 (or higher)
      (WinUAE 3.5.0 or lower)</li>
      <li>Windows 7 with SP1 or higher with Directx 11.0 (WinUAE
      3.6.0 onwards)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href=
    "../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> to configure WinUAE properly. If the
    setup of the program is complete and the emulation is working,
    please refer to <a href="../emulation/main.htm">The
    Emulation</a> for information if you have problems with certain
    Amiga - programs, and also for information on how to get out
    the most of WinUAE.</p>
