  <p class="normal">WinUAE requires DirectX 8 or later, so on Windows 2000, you may need to install a more recent DirectX runtime. Select Start, Run and enter DXDIAG to see what version you have installed.</p>
  <p class="normal">WinUAE no longer supports Windows 9x/NT4. If you need support for such an outdated operating system, WinUAE 0.8.8 still supports Windows NT 4.0 (see <strong>WinUAE-compat.exe</strong>).
    If short on memory or CPU, please use <strong>WinUAE-mini.exe </strong>(0.8.22r8).</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="normal">Also, WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work properly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal">The Kickstart, a ROM chip which contains essential parts of the Operating System and an Amiga can not boot without it.<br>
      A copy of your Kickstart ROM (sometimes referred as a ROM-image, ROM-file, KickFile, or KickROM) into a file called kick.ROM. If you own an Amiga, you can extract a ROM-image using the included <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a> utility, which must be run on your Amiga.<br>
      If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy of a Kickstart ROM from Cloanto's <a href="../credits/about.htm">Amiga Forever</a> software package. Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\</em>ROM. If you have the <strong>Amiga Classix CD</strong>, you can find a Kickstart 1.3 ROM file on it.</li>
    <li class="normal">The Workbench, which is the Amiga's User Interface to manage files and start applications, in other terms AmigaOS. <br>
      If you own an Amiga, you can transfer your Workbench disks to the .adf file-format used by UAE by running the included <a href="transdisk.htm"> Transdisk</a> utility. Again, this must be run on your Amiga. If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy of various Amiga OS releases from Cloanto's Amiga Forever software package.<br>
      A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench directory hard disk set up in <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
      Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5</strong> or <strong>3.9</strong> CD can be purchased from any good <a href="../links.htm#shops">Amiga dealer</a> and can be read directly on a PC as a Read Only Directory based Hard Disk on WinUAE.<br>
      If you have WB 2.0 or better, try ADF Blitzer, which has a nice Workbench frontend!</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">If you are done with creating the necessary files on your Amiga, have a look at the <a href="pcamitrans.htm">Data Transfer Amiga &lt;-&gt; PC</a> page.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="normal">Lastly, please keep in mind that WinUAE
    is a fairly hungry application and requires a lot of computing power to accurately emulate the Amiga. The following system is recommended before running WinUAE:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal">Pentium IV 2GHz (or better)</li>
    <li class="normal">512MB of RAM</li>
    <li class="normal">Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8 with DirectX 8.0 (or higher) (WinUAE 3.5.0 or lower)</li>
    <li class="normal">Windows 7 with SP1 or higher with Directx 11.0 (WinUAE 3.6.0 onwards)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> to
    configure WinUAE properly. If the setup of the program is complete and the emulation is working, please refer to <a href="../emulation/main.htm">The Emulation</a> for information if you have problems with certain Amiga - programs, and also for information on how to get out the most of WinUAE.</p>
