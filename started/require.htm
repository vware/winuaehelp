    <h1>System Requirements</h1>
    <p>Like all emulators, requires a lot of computing power to
    accurately emulate the Amiga. The following system is a
    recommended minimum for running WinUAE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pentium IV 2GHz</li>
      <li>1GB of RAM</li>
      <li>WinUAE 3.6: Windows 7 with SP1 or higher</li>
      <li>WinUAE 3.5: Windows 2000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The last version to support Windows NT 4.0 was WinUAE 0.8.8
    (see <strong>winuae-compat.exe</strong>). If short on memory or
    CPU performance, please use <strong>winuae-mini.exe</strong>
    (0.8.22r8).</p>
    <h1>Emulation Requirements</h1>
    <p>WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work
    properly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Kickstart, a ROM chip which contains essential parts
      of the Operating System and an Amiga can not boot without
      it.<br>
        A copy of a Kickstart ROM (sometimes referred as a
        ROM-image, ROM-file, KickFile, or KickROM) has to be loaded
        by WinUAE, just like a real Amiga would. If you own an
        Amiga, you can extract a ROM-image using the included
        <a href="../emulation/amigaprogs.htm">transrom</a> utility,
        which must be run on the Amiga.<br>
        If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy
        of a Kickstart ROM from the <a href=
        "../credits/about.htm">Amiga Forever</a> software package.
        Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga
        Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ROM</em>. If
        you have the <strong>Amiga Classix CD</strong>, you can
        find a Kickstart version 1.3 ROM file on it.
      </li>
      <li>The Workbench, which is the Amiga's user interface to
      manage files and start applications, in other terms
      AmigaOS.<br>
        If you own an Amiga, you can transfer your Workbench disks
        to the .adf file-format used by WinUAE by running the
        included <a href=
        "../emulation/amigaprogs.htm">transdisk</a> utility. Again,
        this must be run on the Amiga. If you no longer own an
        Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy of various Amiga OS
        releases from the Amiga Forever software package.<br>
        A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on
        the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in
        <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench
        directory hard disk set up in
        <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
        Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5 or 3.9</strong> CDs can be
        purchased from any good <a href="../links.htm#shops">Amiga
        dealer</a> and can be read directly on the PC by
        WinUAE.<br>
        If you have WB 2.0 or better, try ADF Blitzer, which has a
        nice Workbench front end!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are done with creating the necessary files on your
    Amiga, have a look at the <a href=
    "../howto/pcamitrans.htm">Data Transfer from/to Amiga</a>
    page.</p>
    <p>If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href=
    "../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> to configure WinUAE properly. If the
    setup of the program is complete and the emulation is working,
    please refer to <a href="../emulation/main.htm">The
    Emulation</a> for information if you have problems with certain
    Amiga programs, and also for information on how to get the most
    out of WinUAE.</p>
