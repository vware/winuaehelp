    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Like all emulators, requires a lot of computing power to
    accurately emulate the Amiga. The following system is a
    recommended minimum for running WinUAE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pentium IV 2GHz</li>
      <li>1GB of RAM</li>
      <li>WinUAE 3.6: Windows 7 with SP1 or higher</li>
      <li>WinUAE 3.5: Windows 2000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The last version to support Windows NT 4.0 was WinUAE 0.8.8
    (see <strong>winuae-compat.exe</strong>). If short on memory or
    CPU performance, please use <strong>winuae-mini.exe</strong>
    (0.8.22r8).</p>
    <h1>Emulation Requirements</h1>
    <p>WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work
    properly. This software is not included for legal reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A copy of a <a href=
      "../background/kickst.htm">Kickstart</a> ROM. Sometimes
      referred as a ROM-image, ROM-file, KickFile, or KickROM - has
      to be loaded by WinUAE on startup, just like a real Amiga
      would. It can be extracted from an original Amiga with the
      <a href="../emulation/amigaprogs.htm">transrom</a>.
      Alternatively, a legal copy can be obtained with the
        <a href="../credits/about.htm">Amiga Forever</a> software
        package. Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga
        Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ROM</em>. If
        you have the <strong>Amiga Classix CD</strong>, you can
        find a Kickstart version 1.3 ROM file on it.
      </li>
      <li>The Workbench, which is the Amiga's user interface to
      manage files and start applications, in other terms
      AmigaOS.<br>
        Workbench disks can be transferred to the ADF file-format
        used by WinUAE by running the included <a href=
        "../emulation/amigaprogs.htm">transdisk</a> utility. Also,
        a legal copy of various AmigaOS releases can be found in
        the Amiga Forever software package.<br>
        A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on
        the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in
        <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench
        directory hard disk set up in
        <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
        Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5 or 3.9</strong> CDs can be
        purchased from any <a href="../links.htm#shops">Amiga
        dealer</a> and can be read directly on the PC by
        WinUAE.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href=
    "../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> to configure WinUAE. If the setup of
    the program is complete and the emulation is working, please
    refer to <a href="../emulation/main.htm">Emulation</a> for
    information on how to to get the most out of WinUAE.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Neither WinUAE itself nor this help
    will point you at illegal content sites, nor will you be
    provided with copyrighted material by any of the involved
    people.</p>
