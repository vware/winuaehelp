<p class="text">If you are using Windows 95 and don't have DirectX installed
  yet, you need to grab and install a copy first. UAE works with DirectX 8 or
  later. Select Start, Run and enter DXDIAG to see what version you have installed.
  WinUAE no longer supports Windows NT 4.0, please use Windows 9x/ME/2000 or
  XP. WinUAE 0.8.8 still supports Windows NT 4.0 (see <strong>WinUAE-compat.exe</strong>).
  If short on memory or CPU, please use the <strong>WinUAE-mini.exe </strong>(0.8.22r8).</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work properly:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">The Kickstart, a ROM chip which contains essential parts of
    the Operating System and an Amiga can not boot without it.<br>
    A copy of your Kickstart ROM (sometimes referred as a ROM-image, ROM-file,
    KickFile, or KickROM) into a file called kick.ROM. If you own an Amiga, you
    can extract a ROM-image using the included <a href="transrom.htm">Transrom</a> utility,
    which must be run on your Amiga.<br>
    If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy of a Kickstart
    ROM from Cloanto's <a href="../credits/about.htm">Amiga Forever</a> software
    package. Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD
    in <em>\Emulation\shared\</em>ROM. If you have the <strong>Amiga Classix
    CD</strong>, you can find a Kickstart 1.3 ROM file on it.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">The Workbench, which is the Amiga's User Interface to manage
    files and start applications, in other terms AmigaOS. <br>
    If you own an Amiga, you can transfer your Workbench disks to the .adf file-format
    used by UAE by running the included <a href="transdisk.htm"> Transdisk</a> utility.
    Again, this must be run on your Amiga. If you no longer own an Amiga, you
    can obtain a legal copy of various Amiga OS releases from Cloanto's Amiga
    Forever software package.<br>
    A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on the <strong>Amiga
    Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench
    directory hard disk set up in <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
    Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5</strong> or <strong>3.9</strong> CD can
    be purchased from any good <a href="../links.htm#shops">Amiga dealer</a> and
    can be read directly on a PC as a Read Only Directory based Hard Disk on
    WinUAE.<br>
    If you have WB 2.0 or better, try ADF Blitzer, which has a nice Workbench
    frontend!</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If you are done with creating the necessary files on your Amiga,
  have a look at the <a href="pcamitrans.htm">Data Transfer Amiga &lt;-&gt; PC</a> page.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Kickstart ROMs and Workbench disks are
  COPYRIGHTED by Amiga Inc and it is ILLEGAL to distribute them or download them
  from unauthorised sites. No one of the WinUAE team will provide any of those
  files. Original disks can be purchased from <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a> directly
  or <a href="../links.htm#shops">one of the listed shops</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE is a fairly hungry application and requires alot of compute-power
  to accurately emulate the Amiga. The following system is recommended before
  running WinUAE:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Pentium III 1GHz (or higher)</li>
  <li class="text">128MB of RAM</li>
  <li class="text">PCI sound-card</li>
  <li class="text">PCI or AGP graphics-card</li>
  <li class="text">Windows 9x/Me/2000/XP with DirectX 8.0 (or higher)</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> to
  configure WinUAE properly. If the setup of the program is complete and the
  emulation is working, please refer to <a href="../emulation/main.htm">The Emulation</a> for
  information if you have problems with certain Amiga - programs, and also for
  information on how to get out the most of WinUAE.</p>
