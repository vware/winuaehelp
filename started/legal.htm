    <p>To actually run anything in WinUAE, you will need to install
    a Amiga Kickstart ROM image from an Amiga. You can't run WinUAE
    if you don't have this image.<br>
    Please see <a href="require.htm">Emulation Requirements</a> for
    information on which files you need.</p>
    <p>Note: if you transfer commercial software, you must not
    distribute the resulting image files without permission of the
    copyright owner. Please read the license that came with your
    software for details.<br>
    Neither WinUAE itself nor this help will point you at illegal
    download sites, nor will you be provided with copyrighted
    material by any of the involved people.</p>
