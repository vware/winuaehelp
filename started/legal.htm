  <p class="normal">To actually run anything in UAE, you will need to install a Amiga
    Kickstart ROM image from an Amiga. You can't run UAE if you don't have this
    image.</p>
  <p class="normal">Kickstart ROMs and Workbench disks are COPYRIGHTED by Amiga,
    Inc. and it is ILLEGAL to distribute them or download them from unauthorised
    sites.</p>
  <p class="normal"> These files are not included in WinUAE because of this. If you
    own a real Amiga, you can create everything you need yourself. This can be
    done with <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a>. Alternatively, emulation packages
    can be bought from <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a> directly or
    at <a href="../links.htm#shops">one of the listed shops</a>.</p>
  <p class="normal">If you transfer commercial software, you must not distribute
    the resulting image files without permission of the copyright owner. The Kickstart
    ROM has to be considered commercial software. You may not distribute Kickstart
    ROM files. Please read the license that came with your software for details.</p>
  <p class="normal">Neither WinUAE nor this helpfile will point you at illegal download
    sites, nor will you be provided with copyrighted material by any of the involved
    people.</p>
