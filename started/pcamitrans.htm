  <p class="normal">In the process of preparing for emulation, you will need to transfer
    the files between your PC where you run UAE on and your Amiga. There are several
    ways how to do this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="normal">Serial transfer. You will need to connect the Amiga and the
      PC with a null modem cable.</li>
    <li class="normal">Transfer via floppies. Requires you to have AmigaOS 2.0 or
      later.</li>
    <li class="normal">Direct copy of floppies using FDI. With 2 floppy drives in
      your PC, this is a nice method.</li>
    <li class="normal">Network. With a networking card in both, the Amiga and the
      PC, you will get best results with this solution.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="normal">In either case, you ought to read the documentation for the programs
    that you use for the transfer.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Serial Transfer</h2>
  <p class="normal">If you are using a null modem cable, you will need a terminal
    program on your Windows machine and your Amiga. 68000 equipped Amigas are only
    able to reach approximately 3000cps through the null modem cable. This speed
    is achieved with the standard serial.device or the new baudbandit.device There
    are some tools available which can speed up the connection speed up to 5500cps.
    For more help on how to set up a serial transfer see <a href="../links.htm">ADF
    Sender Terminal FAQ</a> and <a href="../links.htm#tools">WarTrans</a>. The <a href="../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> is
    a great source for such tools such as TwinExpress and AmiTrans.</p>
  <p class="normal">All you need is the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal">Terminal software for Amiga and PC, preferably ones than can
      do Binary Transfers using common protocols such as Kermit and X/Y/ZModem.
      Amiga term programs include NComm, JRComm, and Term. PC term programs include
      Terminal and Terminus.</li>
    <li class="normal">A commonly used program called Twin Express can be used instead
      or <em>PC2Ami</em> or <a href="../links.htm#tools">AmigaTrans</a> or Amiga
      Explorer from <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a>.</li>
    <li class="normal">A serial cable with 9pin end for PC and 25 pin end for Amiga.
      It has to be a null-modem cable which means that lines 2 and 3 have to cross
      over to receive/transmit between peers and line 7 for control signals. See <a href="../links.htm#help">RS232
      cable information</a> for a null modem cable specification.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">Then, do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"> Connect the computers with serial lead and load up the software
      on each end.</li>
    <li class="normal"> Start binary receive on one end using one of the protocols
      common to both programs.</li>
    <li class="normal"> Start binary transmit on the other and load the file to be
      transmitted, it should then transfer to the other end in seconds/minutes
      depending on size.</li>
    <li class="normal">Further details of networking can be found at <a href="../links.htm#help">Amiga
      Emulation FAQ</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="dtH2">Floppy transfer</h2>
  <p class="normal">If you have an Amiga with OS 2.0 or later, you may use <strong>CrossDOS</strong>.
    It is a part of the AmigaOS and enables you to read and write DOS formatted
    floppies on your Amiga. <strong>MessyDOS</strong> or <strong>MSH</strong> is
    a freeware program with the same functionality. It can be found on Aminet.
    If you do not have a high density floppy drive in your Amiga, you will have
    to use 720kB formatted disks. Compress the disk image with - for example -
    LHA and copy the compressed file on the floppy. Copy the file to your Windows
    machine and decompress it.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Compact Flash Transfer</h2>
  <p class="normal">If your PC or Mac has a Compact Flash reader installed and have a real Amiga, you can install <a href="http://amigakit.leamancomputing.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=440">EasyADF</a> which includes a PCMCIA card reader which allows you to easily create, read and transfer ADF or other files between the Amiga and your Mac or PC to run on your Emulator.</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Direct Copy</h2>
  <p class="normal">If you have a PC with 2 floppy drives then you can use <a href="../links.htm#tools">Disk2FDI</a> which
    will allow you to read an Amiga disk in A: and read and transfer the contents
    to the B: drive. The FDI files can then be directly read with WinUAE.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Network Transfer</h2>
  <p class="normal">If you have <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto's</a> Amiga
    Explorer program then you can set up a PC to Amiga link and use a friendly
    front end program to transfer programs to and from your PC and your Amiga.<br>
    You can also use AmigaToPC, which is a professional network software setup,
    and can be found at our links page in the <a href="../links.htm#tools">tools
    section</a>.</p>
