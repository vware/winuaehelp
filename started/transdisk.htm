    <p>A disk file is an image of the raw data on an Amiga floppy
    disk, it contains 901120 bytes (880kB), which is the standard
    capacity of an Amiga disk. Transdisk will dump an image of a
    floppy in one of the drives, or write an image to an Amiga
    disk.</p>
    <h1>Disk to ADF</h1>
    <p>transdisk &gt;RAM:DF0.adf</p>
    <p>This command will create a file called "DF0.adf" in the RAM
    disk. Such a file is 901120 bytes of size for one disk.</p>
    <p>You can also create disk images in several parts. To create
    4 parts of the disk in DF0: do the following:</p>
    <p>transdisk &gt;ram:DF0_1.adf -s 0 -e 19<br>
    transdisk &gt;ram:DF0_2.adf -s 20 -e 39<br>
    transdisk &gt;ram:DF0_3.adf -s 40 -e 59<br>
    transdisk &gt;ram:DF0_4.adf -s 60 -e 79</p>
    <p>After you <a href="pcamitrans.htm">transferred</a> the files
    to your PC, you have to merge them again. To do so in the DOS
    prompt:</p>
    <p>COPY /B DF0_1.adf+DF0_2.adf+DF0_3.adf+DF0_4.adf DF0.adf</p>
    <h1>ADF to Disk</h1>
    <p>It is possible to transfer an ADF disk image back to an
    original Amiga disk. Copy the ADF to an original Amiga and
    insert a disk into DF0. Then, you will also need transdisk in
    order to transfer the data to the disk. Do the following:</p>
    <p>transdisk -w filename.adf</p>
    <p>If you do not have an Amiga to write to Amiga disks, then it
    is suggested to get hold of the PCI Catweasel device which will
    allow you to write ADF files to Amiga formatted disks on your
    PC. See <a href="../links.htm#shops">Individual Computers</a>
    for more information.</p>
    <p>You can also get direct access to an Amiga's floppy drive if
    you have your PC and Amiga networked and using the <a href=
    "../links.htm#allinone">Amiga Explorer</a> supplied with
    Cloanto's Amiga Forever software.</p>
