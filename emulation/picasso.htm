    <p>Emulating the <a href="../custchips.htm">Custom Chipset</a>
    is comparatively slow, instead, you can use the PC's graphics
    card. This also gives access to higher resolutions and better
    color modes.</p>
    <h2>Set Up</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To use this feature, you must select at least a 68020 CPU
      with a 32 bit address space in the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">
        CPU</a> tab. You also need a Kickstart 3.x ROM.
      </li>
      <li>To specify how much graphics memory you want to emulate,
      you must adjust the RTG in the <a href=
      "../gui/ram.htm">RAM</a> tab.
      </li>
      <li>Make sure Full Screen RTG is enabled on the <a href=
      "../gui/display.htm">Display</a> tab.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, you need the <a href="../links.htm#essential">Picasso
    96 software</a> which is not distributed with WinUAE. Version
    1.31 or higher is recommended. Once the software is installed
    on the emulated Amiga, it must be rebooted. After that new
    display modes will be available - which are identified as
    <em>uaegfx</em> - from the ScreenModes program on the
    Amiga.</p>
    <h2>Maximize Stability and Performance</h2>
    <p>Make sure you utilize the latest rtg.library which is
    located in the <a href="../tips/amigaprogs.htm">Amiga
    Programs</a> folder of your WinUAE installation. You have to
    copy that file into the following directory on your Workbench
    drive: <em>libs:picasso96</em>.<br>
    Start the program p96_uae_tweak from the Amiga Programs folder
    if you notice large slowdown when 16bit AHI is activated.</p>
    <h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently only Permedia 2 and Voodoo cards are compatible
      with the Warp3D driver software for 3D games on the
      Amiga.</li>
      <li>If you get no Picasso screens larger than 1024x768 in
      32bit, you have to copy picasso96fix from the <a href=
      "../tips/amigaprogs.htm">Amiga Programs</a> directory to a
      drive in your emulated Amiga, and load it in the
      startup-sequence before the LoadWB command.
      </li>
    </ul>
