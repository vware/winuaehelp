  <p class="normal">Emulating the OCS, ECS or AGA chipset is slow, instead, you can
    use the PC's graphics card instead to output graphics and use 256 or more colors.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Set Up</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal">To use this feature, you must select 68020 emulation with
      a 32 bit address space in the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU</a> tab. You also
      need a Kickstart 3.x ROM.</li>
    <li class="normal">To specify how much graphics memory you want to emulate, you
      must adjust the RTG in the <a href="../gui/ram.htm">RAM</a> tab.</li>
    <li class="normal"> Make sure Full Screen RTG is enabled on the <a href="../gui/display.htm">Display</a> tab. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">Then, you need the <a href="../links.htm#essential">Picasso 96
    software</a> which is not distributed with WinUAE. Version 1.31 or higher
    is recommended. After you installed the Picasso96 software, reboot the emulated
    Amiga. Now, you should be able to select the new modes - which are identiefied
    as <em>uaegfx</em> - from the ScreenModes program on the Amiga.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Maximize Stability and Performance</h2>
  <p class="normal">Make sure you utilize the latest rtg.library which is located
    in the <a href="../tips/amigaprogs.htm">Amiga Programs</a> folder of your WinUAE
    installation. You have to copy that file into the following directory on your
    Workbench drive: <em>libs:picasso96</em>.</p>
  <p class="normal"> Start the program p96_uae_tweak from the Amiga Programs folder
    if you notice large slowdown when 16bit AHI is activated.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Trouble Shooting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Currently only Permedia 2 and Voodoo cards are compatible with the Warp3D
      driver software for 3D games on the Amiga.</li>
    <li>If you get no Picasso screens larger than 1024x768 in 32bit, you have to
      copy picasso96fix from the <a href="../tips/amigaprogs.htm">Amiga Programs</a> directory
      to a drive in your emulated Amiga, and load it in the startup-sequence before
      the LoadWB command.</li>
