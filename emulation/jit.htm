    <p>UAE has always been hampered by being somewhat lacking in
    CPU performance.<br>
    Undoubtedly, it was amazingly fast for what it did, but it
    never really was an alternative to a decked out, no expense
    spared Amiga. The Just In Time compiler should help change
    that.</p>
    <p>UAE can now emulate the CPU at considerably more than 060
    speeds. That should do for a while - although further speedups
    are still possible.</p>
    <p>A description of what the settings will cause the JIT
    compiler to do:</p>
    <p><strong>Cache Size:</strong> The size (in kB) the JIT
    compiler uses to store pre-translated code. When this becomes
    full, or when the OS issues a flush icache instruction, this
    gets completely emptied, and then refilled during execution.
    Setting it to 0 will disable the JIT compiler.</p>
    <p><strong>Const Jump:</strong> If this enabled, unconditional
    branches will not end a block. Effectively, UAE-JIT compiles
    "through" them. Generally, that's a good idea, as it improves
    performance.<br>
    However, it makes soft cache flushing impossible for some
    blocks, so if you experience lots and lots of soft cache
    flushes (e.g. when using a Mac emulator), you might try "no"
    and see whether it does any better.</p>
    <p><strong>FPU Support:</strong> If this is enabled, the JIT
    compiler will be used for the most commonly used FPU
    instructions. Unchecking this option will disable JIT-compiling
    for the FPU.</p>
    <p><strong>Force Settings:</strong> Will force the JIT compiler
    to work with the method the user chooses.</p>
    <p><strong>Direct, Indirect, After Picasso:</strong> These
    describe how aggressive to be when it comes to accessing Amiga
    memory. If you choose "Direct", the emulation will be very
    aggressive. If you choose "Indirect", the emulation will always
    use the slower but safe method. "AfterPic" uses the safe method
    until the first time a Picasso96 mode is switched on, and the
    aggressive method<br>
    from then on. Unless you are not using P96 graphics, there
    isn't much point setting this to "direct". During the startup,
    weird and wonderful things happen in the Amiga, and only having
    faith in the aggressive method once that difficult time is over
    is certainly a wise thing to do.</p>
    <p><strong>No Flags:</strong> Whether to optimize away flag
    generation when it isn't needed. There really shouldn't be any
    reason why you'd want to disable this option. If you find
    something that<br>
    works with "no" and doesn't with "yes", it most likely is a bug
    and you should <a href="../credits/contrib.htm">report</a>
    it.</p>
    <p><strong>Hard Flush:</strong> If this is unchecked, an OS
    induced icache flush doesn't actually empty the cache, but
    instead checksumming will be used to check whether blocks have
    to be discarded. You'll probably want to leave this at its
    default (otherwise lots of stuff, like the OS, gets translated
    over and over).</p>
    <p>The JIT patch was developed by Bernd "Bernie" Meyer, this
    description is a slightly edited and very shortened version of
    his documentation.</p>
