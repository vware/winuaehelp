  <p class="normal">UAE has always been hampered by being somewhat lacking in CPU
    performance.<br>
    Undoubtedly, it was amazingly fast for what it did, but it never really was
    an alternative to a decked out, no expense spared Amiga. The Just In Time compiler
    should help change that.</p>
  <p class="normal">UAE can now emulate the CPU at considerably more than 060 speeds.
    That should do for a while - although further speedups are still possible.</p>
  <p class="normal">A description of what the settings will cause the JIT compiler to do:</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>Cache Size:</strong> The size (in kB) the JIT compiler
    uses to store pretranslated code. When this becomes full, or when the OS issues
    a flush icache instruction, this gets completely emptied, and then refilled
    during execution. Setting it to 0 will disable the JIT compiler.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>Const Jump:</strong> If this enabled, unconditional branches
    will not end a block. Effectively, UAE-JIT compiles &quot;through&quot; them.
    Generally, that's a good idea, as it improves performance.<br>
    However, it makes soft cache flushing impossible for some blocks, so if you
    experience lots and lots of soft cache flushes (e.g. when using a Mac emulator),
    you might try &quot;no&quot; and see whether it does any better.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>FPU Support:</strong> If this is enabled, the JIT compiler
    will be used for the most commonly used FPU instructions. Unchecking this option
    will disable JIT-compiling for the FPU.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>Force Settings:</strong> Will force the JIT compiler
    to work with the method the user chooses.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>Direct, Indirect, After Picasso:</strong> These describe
    how aggressive to be when it comes to accessing Amiga memory. If you choose &quot;Direct&quot;,
    the emulation will be very aggressive. If you choose &quot;Indirect&quot;,
    the emulation will always use the slower but safe method. &quot;AfterPic&quot; uses
    the safe method until the first time a Picasso96 mode is switched on, and the
    aggressive method<br>
    from then on. Unless you are not using P96 graphics, there isn't much point
    setting this to &quot;direct&quot;. During the startup, weird and wonderful
    things happen in the Amiga, and only having faith in the aggressive method
    once that difficult time is over is certainly a wise thing to do.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>No Flags:</strong> Whether to optimize away flag generation
    when it isn't needed. There really shouldn't be any reason why you'd want to
    disable this option. If you find something that<br>
    works with &quot;no&quot; and doesn't with &quot;yes&quot;, it most likely
    is a bug and you should <a href="../credits/contrib.htm">report</a> it.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>Hard Flush:</strong> If this is unchecked, an OS induced
    icache flush doesn't actually empty the cache, but instead checksumming will
    be used to check whether blocks have to be discarded. You'll probably want
    to leave this at its default (otherwise lots of stuff, like the OS, gets translated
    over and over).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="normal">The JIT patch was developed by Bernd &quot;Bernie&quot; Meyer,
    this description is a slightly edited and very shortened version of his documentation.</p>
