<h2><u>JIT - Just In Time compiler</u></h2>
<p>UAE has always been hampered by being somewhat lacking in CPU performance.<br>
  Undoubtedly, it was amazingly fast for what it did, but it never really was 
  an alternative to a decked out, no expense spared Amiga. The Just In Time compiler 
  should help change that.</p>
<p>UAE can now emulate the CPU at considerably more than 060 speeds. That<br>
  should do for a while - although further speedups are still possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A description of what the settings will cause the JIT compiler to do:</p>
<p><b><u>Cache Size:</u></b> The size (in kB) the JIT compiler uses to store pretranslated 
  code. When this becomes full, or when the OS issues a flush icache instruction, 
  this gets completely emptied, and then refilled during execution. Setting it 
  to 0 will disable the JIT compiler.</p>
<p><u><b>Const Jump:</b></u> If this enabled, unconditional branches will not 
  end a block. Effectively, UAE-JIT compiles &quot;through&quot; them. Generally, 
  that's a good idea, as it improves performance.<br>
  However, it makes soft cache flushing impossible for some blocks, so if you 
  experience lots and lots of soft cache flushes (e.g. when using a Mac emulator), 
  you might try &quot;no&quot; and see whether it does any better.<br>
</p>
<p><u><b>FPU Support:</b></u> If this is enabled, the JIT compiler will be used 
  for the most commonly used FPU instructions. Unchecking this option will disable 
  JIT-compiling for the FPU.<br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Force Settings:</u></b> Will force the JIT compiler to work with the 
  method the user chooses.<br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Direct, Indirect, After Picasso:</u></b> These describe how aggressive 
  to be when it comes to accessing Amiga memory. If you choose &quot;Direct&quot;, 
  the emulation will be very aggressive. If you choose &quot;Indirect&quot;, the 
  emulation will always use the slower but safe method. &quot;AfterPic&quot; uses 
  the safe method until the first time a Picasso96 mode is switched on, and the 
  aggressive method<br>
  from then on. Unless you are not using P96 graphics, there isn't much point 
  setting this to &quot;direct&quot;. During the startup, weird and wonderful 
  things happen in the Amiga, and only having faith in the aggressive method once 
  that difficult time is over is certainly a wise thing to do.</p>
<p><b><u>No Flags:</u></b> Whether to optimize away flag generation when it isn't 
  needed. There really shouldn't be any reason why you'd want to disable this 
  option. If you find something that<br>
  works with &quot;no&quot; and doesn't with &quot;yes&quot;, it most likely is 
  a bug and you should <a href="../credits/contrib.htm">report</a> it.</p>
<p><b><u>Hard Flush:</u></b> If this is unchecked, an OS induced icache flush 
  doesn't actually empty the <br>
  cache, but instead checksumming will be used to check whether blocks have to 
  be discarded. You'll probably want to leave this at its default (otherwise lots 
  of stuff, like the OS, gets translated over and over).</p>
<p></p>

<p>The JIT patch was developed by Bernd &quot;Bernie&quot; Meyer, this description 
  is a slightly edited and very shortened version of his documentation.</p>
