    <p>Along with the WinUAE emulator program, some programs are
    supplied in the 'Amiga Programs' folder in the C:\Program
    Files\WinUAE folder. Here is an explanation of what these files
    are for and where to copy them to:</p>
    <h1>MouseHack</h1>
    <p>Copy this program file to your C directory on your Workbench
    disk or hard disk. This program will hack your mouse connected
    to your PC to work with WinUAE. In most cases it may not be
    needed. You can auto run it by adding a line to the
    s:user-startup file on your Workbench disk. Needed when using
    tablets. Tablets only work properly if you select "mousehack
    mouse" and run mousehack on the Amiga side.</p>
    <h1>Picasso96fix</h1>
    <p>Copy this program file to your C directory on your Workbench
    disk or hard disk. This program will fix Picasso 96 RTG screens
    greater than 1024 pixels when using your PC's graphics card
    with the uaegfx driver in WinUAE. Load it before LoadWB in the
    startup-sequence. The <strong>Picasso96fix.bb</strong> file is
    the source code to this program written in Blitz Basic.</p>
    <h1>rtg.library</h1>
    <p>Retargetable Graphics Library. Copy this library file to
    your libs:picasso96. This library will increase the speed of
    WinUAE a lot.</p>
    <h1>timehack</h1>
    <p>This tool synchronizes the Amiga time with the current
    Windows time every second. You need this when you use the
    hibernation feature of your PC and resume to get exact time. If
    you need exact time (for compiler make) it is also recommended
    to use this because UAE cycletiming differs of about 1-2
    seconds per hour.</p>
    <p>Copy it to the Amiga system directory c. Start it in your
    Userstartup with the command run &gt;nil: timehack.</p>
    <h1>transdisk</h1>
    <p>Copy this program file to your C directory on your Workbench
    disk or hard disk. This can Transfer Disk images to or from
    floppy disk to an image or vice versa in ADF (Amiga Disk
    Format). Type <em>transdisk ?</em> for more options. See
    <a href="../howto/imagefiles.htm">Create Image Files</a> page
    for more details on this program.</p>
    <h1>transrom</h1>
    <p>Copy this program file to your C directory on your Workbench
    disk or hard disk. This can Transfer the Kickstart ROM image
    from a real Amiga to an image file to use with your Amiga
    Emulator. It will produce either a 256K or 512kB sized file.
    See <a href="../howto/imagefiles.htm">Create Image Files</a>
    page for more details on this program.</p>
    <h1>UAE</h1>
    <p>Copy this file to the AHI driver drawer in Devs on your
    Workbench disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's
    sound system using AHI retargetable sound driver system.</p>
    <h1>UAE.audio</h1>
    <p>This is the AHI Driver for UAE. It enables support for
    recording and playback with a sampling rate up to 96 kHz in 16
    bit. Copy this file to the Devs:AHI driver drawer in Devs on
    your Workbench disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate the
    Amiga's sound system using AHI retargetable sound driver
    system. This driver works fully independent from Paula sound.
    For a speed boost on slower systems, you can set the Paula
    buffer to 5 or 6, and chose 11kHz Mono, which is enough to hear
    system sounds.<br>
    If you installed the driver correctly, it should offer you only
    1 mode: UAE HiFi stereo++.</p>
    <h1>UAE_German</h1>
    <p>This is a German keymap file for access to @\~{[]} with
    ALT-GR like windows. Copy it to devs/keymaps and select in
    Input prefs.</p>
    <p>Note: This is an old one that works in input compatibility
    mode. For 100% compatibility Mode (Euro Char) use
    German_keymap_new.lha in this folder and choose anything other
    in input tab then Compatibility Mode and remap # Key to
    0x2b.</p>
    <h1>uae_rcli</h1>
    <p>Remote CLI. Usage: uae_rcli [?|-h] [-debug] [-nofifo]
    [&lt;delay&gt;]</p>
    <h1>uae-control</h1>
    <p>Copy this program file to your Utilities folder or some
    other folder on your Workbench disk or hard disk. It will
    provide a user interface within the emulator to control the
    floppy drives, reset, quit and other features without having to
    press F12 to bring up the WinUAE interface.</p><img class=
    "center" src="uaecontrol.gif" alt="UAE-Control">
    <h1>uaectrl</h1>
    <p>Copy this program file to your C directory on your Workbench
    disk or hard disk. This is the Shell equivalent of the
    uae-control program where you can change floppies, sound,
    joystick, reset or quit the emulator from a simple text
    menu.</p><img class="center" src="uaectrl.gif" alt=
    "UAE-Control Shell">
    <h1>WinUAEclip</h1>
    <p>This program allows you to have access to Windows Clipboard
    so you can copy/paste files from/to WinUAE.</p>
    <h1>WinUAEnforcer</h1>
    <p>This program allows Enforcer support to detect bad memory
    access when developing programs or debugging. For 100% safety,
    use <a href="../emulation/jit.htm">JIT</a> in Indirect Mode.
    Make sure you use a tool that moves your VBR to Fast RAM. MCP
    or some other tools on Aminet do that. You can also use
    Segtracker from a real Amiga to find the program and offset of
    a hit.</p>
    <h1>winxpprinthelper</h1>
    <p>Not sure what this does yet. Need printer switched on before
    running this.</p>
    <h1>p96_uae_tweak</h1>
    <p>It must run after P96 monitor drivers in user startup.<br>
    If you have copy this program to <em>c:</em>, then type
    <em>&gt;nil: c:p96_uae_tweak</em> in the CLI.<br>
    It is also recommended to set P96 memory from the 4 MB AIAB
    config to 16 or 32 MB, because it works faster. If not enough
    graphics card space is free you will see flicker as before and
    slower moves. Save the configuration and restart WinUAE when
    you have increased the graphics memory size. Crashes may occur
    when you only reboot the emulated Amiga.<br>
    To test it you can boot AIAB open the screenmode prefs window.
    Now put the screenmode prefs window to back and move it around
    underneath other windows.<br>
    If the window moves fast and does not flicker all, you are
    done. With that patch it is also impossible that P96 graphics
    actions can block WinUAE, so you get no AHI 16bit sound
    stuttering when doing a lot of graphics actions.<br>
    The patch splits large P96 blits (&gt;60 pixels) in smaller
    blocks and checks in all blocks if a 16bit AHI buffer is free.
    This avoids speed losses and sound stuttering with 4ms AHI
    latency. Swapbitmaprastport (used for solid window moving and
    some slow layer actions) is patched to use UAE Blitter
    functions that exchange the data directly instead calling 3
    times EOR. It is faster and avoids the heavy flickering when
    moving a smart layer window underneath another window.</p>
    <h1>ahitweak</h1>
    <p><strong>Usage: AHItweak posoffset,pollrate</strong></p>
    <p>This is a program you can start from the CLI or user-startup
    and allows you to tune the AHI driver for better latency,
    because on Windows XP the play pointer position has a delay
    depending on the system and sound card used. Most users do not
    need this tool, but if you have crackle problems with 16bit
    AHI, play a song and try values of 50, 200, 500, 2000, -50,
    -200, -500, and -2000. With some trying, you may be able to get
    good results.You may also try to set the pollrate which WinUAE
    checks for buffers freely between 10 and 60. If you notice a
    speed loss you should set it to 60. If you use low latency
    music software that lets you chose AHI block sizes less than 8
    ms (AHI uses 20ms by default) you can set this to a lower value
    if you hear crackle.</p>
    <h1>p96refresh</h1>
    <p>Start this program to get higher mouse pointer redraw rates
    than 50Hz with P96. Results are seen immediately after call.You
    can start this in your user-startup for automatic load during
    booting the system.<br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you use this, you must check if your
    CPU IDLE slider is set in correct position. In the worst case,
    the Amiga system clock will run slower. Set the IDLE slider so
    that in Windows task manager the CPU load of a Workbench screen
    shows about 10-15%.<br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> p96refresh 75 sets the redraw rate to
    75Hz. It is recommended to set the rate according to the actual
    monitor refresh rate, or the doubled number. Do not set it
    higher or you get a speed loss greater than 2%.</p>
