    <h1>Hard Disks</h1>
    <h2>Directories</h2>
    <p>When mounting a directory as hard disk in WinUAE, files will
    be placed into the host directory. However, the Amiga file
    systems used different and/or additional meta information, so
    by default, UAEFSDB files will be created which store this
    extra information, such as additional protection flags for
    files when using the Directory type of file systems.</p>
    <h2>Hardfiles</h2>
    <p>Hard disk files are large files that contain the image of an
    Amiga file system. They work much the same way as a disk file.
    You can simply create a large empty file and tell UAE to use it
    as a hardfile, but you will need to format it from the
    emulation before you can actually use it.<br>
    If you are want to boot a hardfile under Kickstart 1.3, you
    need the FastFileSystem file from the L: directory to be placed
    in the Kickstart ROMs-directory where WinUAE is installed.<br>
    <br>
    If you are using WinUAE 0.8.22r1 or earlier and Kickstart 1.3
    or earlier, hardfiles can't currently be mounted at boot time,
    and therefore you can't boot from it either. You will have to
    boot either from a <a href="floppies.htm">Floppy Disk Image</a>
    or from a file system, and mount the hardfile.device later. To
    do this, add the following to "DEVS:mountlist":<br>
    <br>
    <em>UAE0:<br>
    Device = uaehf.device<br>
    Unit = 0<br>
    Flags = 0<br>
    Surfaces = 1<br>
    BlocksPerTrack = 32<br>
    Reserved = 1<br>
    Interleave = 0<br>
    LowCyl = 0 ; HighCyl = 511<br>
    Buffers = 5<br>
    DosType = 0x444F5300<br>
    BufMemType = 1<br></em><br>
    <br>
    You may need to adjust the values if you specified a different
    geometry, and/or your hardfile has a different size than 8MB,
    and/or the hardfile is not mounted as UAE0: because you mounted
    other hard disks before it. Then, type "mount UAE0:" (or put
    that command in your startup-sequence), and you should be able
    to access it. Don't forget to format it with the AmigaOS!<br>
    If using HDToolbox to manage Hard files, you must create
    hardfile normally or use hard disk image from your real Amiga
    but clear all hardfile parameters except block size.(sectors,
    surfaces and reserved). HDToolBox must be run with
    "uaehf.device"-parameter ("tools/hdtoolbox uaehf.device")</p>
    <h1>Mounted Drives</h1>
    <p>The following conventions apply for mounting drives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the drive-letter has a Windows volume-name associated
      with it, the drive will get mounted in the Amiga using its
      volume-name. On PCs, the volume name can be set via the
      Properties of the drive in My Computer.</li>
      <li>If no volume-name, the drive gets assigned an Amiga
      volume-name based on its drive-type (the 'x:' is the PC
      drive-letter):</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Drive Letter</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hard Drives</td>
        <td>WinDH_x:</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CD-ROM Drives</td>
        <td>WinCD_x:</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Floppy Drives</td>
        <td>WinDF_x:</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Network Drives</td>
        <td>WinNW_x:</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Removable Drives</td>
        <td>WinRMV_x:</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>RAM Disk Drives</td>
        <td>WinRAM_x:</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If a drive doesn't currently have a
    disc in it (floppy, CD-ROM, etc.), then this option will NOT
    mount the drive for use by the Amiga.</p>
