    <p>Currently, there are 3 ways to print with WinUAE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the same way as classic a Amiga, you can set a
      parallel printer in the WinUAE settings tab <a href=
      "../gui/ports.htm">Game & I/O Ports</a>. Make sure Postscript
      detection and Post Script Printer Emulation are not checked.
      Now you can save your config and can start WinUAE and do the
      rest on the Amiga. If you use turboprint, do not use the
      turboprint spooler and chose parallel port or turbopar for
      the print device. If you print something you should see an
      entry in the Windows printer spooler.
      </li>
      <li>If you have a printer that the Amiga does not support,
      you can choose the Postscript output. For this you need to
      install GhostScript for Windows. In WinUAE, select the
      printer and check the Postscript detection and Post Script
      Printer Emulation. Note: You can't change these settings
      while the emulation is running.<br>
      Boot your emulated Amiga. There is a large probability that
      turboprint does not work with these printer settings, and
      prints out an empty page instead.<br>
      Remove turbostart if you have it and chose the Workbench
      Postscript Printer. Please note that the OS3.5 and OS3.9
      drivers crash when you use greyscale or black and white, this
      function also does not work on real Amigas. So either use an
      older driver or choose color instead. Set it on all printer
      preferences pages. You can chose the real output format in
      the Windows printer driver. The printer must dither colors,
      so it is important to chose 600 or 1200 dpi on the Windows
      side.</li>
      <li>TurboPrint, GhostScript etc. are no longer required, or
      at least the EpsonQ emulator is the easiest way to
      print.</li>
    </ul>
