    <p>On a sufficiently powerful PC, UAE will give you quite an
    authentic flashback into the past. Thanks to DirectX, the raw
    drawing throughput of this version will be among the highest of
    all Intel ports.</p>
    <p>Use the tips below to maximize the performance of your
    emulated Amiga.</p>
    <h2>Memory</h2>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, WinUAE needs 60+Z3+Chip+Fast+Picasso96
    MB of system memory.<br>
    Since WinUAE 0.8.17r1, memory is allocated dynamically. This
    means you can select 512MB Z3 Mem and find no difference in
    boot time, but if you work with UAE for a longer time, it may
    get very slow. So it is better that you calculate your RAM
    needs with the above formula and make sure that it is lower
    than the pysical limit. Windows has to store the data on the
    harddisk if it runs out of RAM, which is a gigantic performance
    hit.<br>
    Also try to activate "Suspend to Disk" mode. UAE and Windows
    will be ready to use within 30 seconds. Do not forget to use
    the <a href="../tips/amigaprogs.htm">timehack</a> to set the
    amigaclock to a correct value.</p>
    <h2>Picasso96</h2>
    <p>When using Workbench, it is strongly recommended to make use
    of WinUAE's Picasso96 support. Using this, you can utilize the
    power of your computer's graphics card to display higher
    resolutions, more colors, and give all graphics output a
    significant speedup.</p>
    <p>Read more details about the correct usage on the <a href=
    "picasso.htm">Picasso96 page</a>.</p>
    <h2>AHI</h2>
    <p>Sound is a luxury in emulation. Because sound output is
    synchronized with video DMA, you won't get clean sound unless
    your machine is capable of running at 50 fps at least
    internally. Again, if you are using the Workbench, it is
    recommended to use AHI as your preferred sound interface.</p>
    <p>If you use programs that need no Paula, set sound output to
    "Disabled, but emulated". To hear system sounds you can use
    ahisyssound found in Aminet.</p>
    <p>For a further speedup, use <a href=
    "../tips/amigaprogs.htm">ahitweak</a>. Increase the poll rate
    (the rate WinUAE checks for soundbuffers). Default is 40, but
    in most cases can be set to 60. Set the sound buffer 4 or 5 in
    the <a href="../gui/sound.htm">Sound</a> tab.</p>
    <h2>Hardfiles</h2>
    <p>Use hardfiles as your main drive to avoid trouble and better
    speed during disk operations, for numerous reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amiga harddrives easily contain several 1000s of files.
      This is quite inefficient if you are using FAT/FAT32 as host
      file system.</li>
      <li>Also, backing up a hardfile is much faster than thousands
      of individual files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is recommended to install the AmigaOS and programs on a
    hardfile, so the access and backup can be done quickly. To
    store pictures and other data, you may use a Windows directory
    for easier data exchange with the PC.<br>
    Transferring data from/to a hardfile can done by simply copying
    it, so you don't have to install all your Amiga stuff
    again.</p>
