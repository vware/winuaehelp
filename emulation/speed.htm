    <p>On a sufficiently powerful PC, UAE will give you quite an
    authentic flashback into the past.</p>
    <p>Use the tips below to maximize the performance of your
    emulated Amiga.</p>
    <h1>Memory</h1>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, WinUAE needs 60+Z3+Chip+Fast+Picasso96
    MB of system memory. Memory is allocated dynamically. This
    means you can select 512MB Z3 memory, which will only be used
    when needed.<br>
    Make sure that the used RAM on your computer is always well
    below the amount of physical memory it has, otherwise the
    operating system has to swap the data to the hard disk if it
    runs out of RAM, which is a huge performance hit.<br>
    Also try to activate "Suspend to Disk" mode. If you do, do not
    forget to use the <a href="amigaprogs.htm">timehack</a> to set
    the Amiga clock to a correct value.</p>
    <h1>Picasso96</h1>
    <p>When using Workbench, it is strongly recommended to make use
    of WinUAE's Picasso96 support. Using this, you can utilize the
    power of your computer's graphics card to display higher
    resolutions, more colors, and give all graphics output a
    significant speedup.<br></p>
    <p>Read more details about the correct usage on the <a href=
    "../howto/picasso.htm">Picasso96 page</a>.</p>
    <h1>AHI</h1>
    <p>Again, if you are using the Workbench, it is recommended to
    use AHI as your preferred sound interface.<br>
    For a further speedup, use <a href=
    "amigaprogs.htm">ahitweak</a>. Increase the poll rate (the rate
    WinUAE checks for sound buffers). You may also try to adjust
    the sound buffer size in the <a href=
    "../gui/sound.htm">Sound</a> tab.</p>
    <h1>Hardfiles</h1>
    <p>It is recommended to install the AmigaOS and programs on a
    hardfile, so the access and backup can be done quickly. To
    store pictures and other data, you may use a Windows directory
    for easier data exchange with the PC.<br>
    Transferring data from/to a hardfile can done by simply copying
    it, so you don't have to install all your Amiga stuff
    again.</p>
