    <p>This tab contains some very important options, because you
    can configure harddisks for your "Amiga".</p><img class=
    "center" src="hdd.png" alt="Winuae - Hard Drives">
    <p>Since using diskfiles is awkward, it is necessary to emulate
    harddisks. There are two ways how you can use large amounts of
    data with UAE: harddisk files and mounted directories.</p>
    <p>To stop the creatiom of _UAEFSDB_ files on the filesystem,
    which stores amiga specific attributes (script), you can tick
    <strong>Disable UAEFSDB support</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Add Directory or Archive..</h2><img class="center" src=
    "harddirectory.png" alt="WinUAE - Add Directory">
    <p>Adds a virtual HDD to your Amiga. You can specify a path to
    your desired folder in Windows,a Volume name and a device name
    (usually DHx) which will be used for the hard drive in the
    emulation.</p>
    <p>This has some major advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It has no problems with Kickstart 1.3</li>
      <li>It is more convenient</li>
      <li>It is much faster</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also use native filesystems to mount Amiga CD-ROMs,
    and you can abuse the hardfile emulation to mount floppy
    disks.<br>
    If you have a AmigaOS 3.9 CD you can boot from the
    <strong>Emergency-Boot</strong> directory to load Workbench (to
    read/write to it, copy the directory to your hard disk first
    and boot from that).</p>
    <p>If you have Cloanto's Amiga Forever, you can boot from the
    supplied shared directory in <strong>C:\Program
    Files\Cloanto\Amiga Forever\Emulation\Shared\<br>
    dir\System</strong> folder. Directory drives can be set to a
    limit of 1 GB.</p>
    <p>Use <strong>Select Archive or plain file</strong> to add an
    archive file (.zip, .7z, .rar, .lha, .lzh, .lzx) to appear as a
    disk on Workbench so there is no need to extract the files
    first.</p>
    <p>You can mount a <strong>CD drive or image</strong> as a disk
    image on the desktop. You can select files of type <strong>cue,
    ccd, mds or iso</strong>. Select the drive or image from the
    pull down menu.</p>
    <p>In earlier versions, directories can be unlimited in size.
    Now you can enable <strong>'Limit size of directory drives to
    1GB</strong>'.</p>
    <h2>Add Hardfile...</h2><img class="center" src="hardfile.png"
    alt="Add Hardfile" height="479">
    <p>With this dialog you can add a hardfile. If you want to use
    an existing file, just click the ... button opposite
    <strong>Path</strong> and select the hdf file. If you want to
    add a new file, specify the number of megabytes (MB) you want
    it to be then click on <strong>Create</strong>, then in the
    dialog box state where on your PC hard disk you want to save
    your file e.g. System.hdf. I suggest 100 MB or greater.<br>
    <br>
    Harddisk files are large files that contain the image of an
    Amiga filesystem. They work much the same way as a disk file.
    You can simply create a large empty file and tell UAE to use it
    as a hardfile, but you will need to format it from the
    emulation before you can actually use it.</p>
    <p>If you are want to boot a hardfile under Kickstart 1.3, you
    need the FastFileSystem file from the L: directory to be placed
    in the kickstart roms-directory where WinUAE is installed.<br>
    <br>
    If you are using WinUAE 0.8.22r1 or earlier and Kickstart 1.3
    or earlier, hardfiles can't currently be mounted at boot time,
    and therefore you can't boot from it either. You will have to
    boot either from a <a href="floppies.htm">Floppy Disk Image</a>
    or from a Filesystem, and mount the hardfile.device later. To
    do this, add the following to "DEVS:mountlist":<br>
    <br>
    <em>UAE0:<br>
    Device = uaehf.device<br>
    Unit = 0<br>
    Flags = 0<br>
    Surfaces = 1<br>
    BlocksPerTrack = 32<br>
    Reserved = 1<br>
    Interleave = 0<br>
    LowCyl = 0 ; HighCyl = 511<br>
    Buffers = 5<br>
    DosType = 0x444F5300<br>
    BufMemType = 1<br></em><br>
    <br>
    You may need to adjust the values if you specified a different
    geometry, and/or your hardfile has a different size than 8MB,
    and/or the hardfile is not mounted as UAE0: because you mounted
    other harddisks before it. Then, type "mount UAE0:" (or put
    that command in your startup-sequence), and you should be able
    to access it. Don't forget to format it with the AmigaOS!</p>
    <p>If using HDToolbox to manage Hard files, then you must
    create hardfile normally or use harddisk image from your real
    Amiga but clear all<br>
    hardfile parameters except block size.(sectors, surfaces and
    reserved)</p>
    <p>HDToolBox must be run with "uaehf.device"-parameter
    ("tools/hdtoolbox uaehf.device")</p>
    <p>The <strong>HD Controller</strong> can emulate which
    controller to use such as <strong>UAE, IDE, SCSI, PCMCIA SRAM
    or IDE</strong>.</p>
    <p>Once you have selected a hardfile, it will display details
    about the cylinders, blocks, size and DOS type in the box.</p>
    <p>Settings:</p>
    <p><strong>Enable RDB mode</strong> - Enable Rigid Disk Block
    mode, this stores the partition and filesystem information in a
    special block of disk (similar to the Master Boot Record on
    PCs).</p>
    <p><strong>RDB/OFS/FFS</strong> - Set file system to Rigid Disk
    Block mode, Original File System (WB 1.3) or Fast File System
    (WB 2.x, 3.x). Newer filesystems include PFS3 (Professional
    Filing System), PDS3, SFS (Smart File System) and Custom
    filesystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Sparse file</strong> - Formats disk file as a file
    which attemprs to use disk space more efficently when it is
    mostly empty by using metadata to represent empty space.</p>
    <p><strong>Dynamic HDF</strong> - Modern disk file format which
    expands as more data is added to the disk file, minimises disk
    usage like Dynamic VHD files on PC.</p>
    <p><strong>DOS type -</strong> Displays the filesystem name in
    Hexadecimal format.</p>
    <h2>Add Harddrive...</h2><img class="center" src=
    "harddrive.png" alt="Hard Drive Settings">
    <p><br>
    You can now add complete Harddrives to WinUAE, select from a
    dropdown list. This list will only pick up Amiga formatted
    drives, Amithlon partitions and empty partitions (not Windows
    partitions). Tick the <strong>Read/Write</strong> option if you
    wish to read and write to such a partition. The boxes below
    will display details about the hard drive selected, such as
    size.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Windows 2000, XP, 7, 8 or later is
    required for this feature! You must also possess administrator
    rights!</p>
    <p><strong>Remove</strong> removes a harddisk from the
    configuration. Simply select a harddisk and click "Remove".</p>
    <p><strong>Properties</strong> allows you to change the
    settings for your virtual HDD. To adjust, click your desired
    HDD and select properties.</p>
    <p><strong>Include removable drives</strong> allows you to
    include USB drives or compact flash cards etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Include CD/DVD Drives</strong> allows you to add
    optical drives without needing a CDROM driver.</p>
    <p><strong>Automount Removable drives</strong> allows you to
    add removable drives such as USB, Firewire, Zip drives when a
    disk is inserted.</p>
    <p><strong>Add PC Drives at Startup</strong> mounts all
    available PC drive-letters for the Amiga to use except CD
    drives, using the following naming convention:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the drive-letter has a Windows volume-name associated
      with it, the drive will get mounted in the Amiga using its
      volume-name. On PCs, the volume name can be set via the
      Properties of the drive in My Computer.</li>
      <li>If no volume-name, the drive gets assigned an Amiga
      volume-name based on its drive-type (the 'x:' is the PC
      drive-letter):</li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Drive Letter</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hard Drives</td>
        <td>WinDH_x:</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>RAM Disk Drives</td>
        <td>WinRAM_x:</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If a drive doesn't currently have a
    disc in it (floppy, CD-ROM, etc.), then this option will NOT
    mount the drive for use by the Amiga.</p>
    <p><strong>Include Network Drives:</strong> Add any mapped
    network drives to the hard drive list, for example, shared
    folders on other computers.</p>
    <p><strong>Disable UAEFSDB Support</strong> - This will disable
    the create of UAEFSDB files which store extra information such
    as additional protection flags for files when using Directory
    type of file systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Don't use Windows Recycle Bin</strong> - Excludes
    Windows Recycle Bin from emulation.</p>
    <p><strong>CDFS automount CD/DVD drives</strong> allows you to
    mount compact discs and DVDS without having to install a CD
    filing system.</p>
    <h2>Add SCSI Tape Drive...</h2><img class="center" src=
    "tapedrive.png" alt="Winuae - Tape Drive">
    <p>You can now add Tape Drives to Winuae. Select a Path to a
    folder where data can be read or written to. It will work with
    Amix and any backup software that requires a tape drive.</p>
    <p><strong>Select directory</strong> Browse for an directory on
    hard disk to emulate tape drive.</p>
    <p><strong>Select archive or plain file</strong> Browse for an
    archive or normal backup file.</p>
    <p><strong>Eject</strong> Remove the tape from the drive.</p>
    <p><strong>HD Controller</strong>Specify controller to emulate
    e.g. UAE, IDE, SCSI, PCMCIA SRAM, PCMCIA IDE.</p>
    <p><strong>Read / write</strong> Enable read and write mode for
    tape drive otherwise it will use Read only mode.</p>
    <p><strong>Add Tape Drive</strong> will add the new emulated
    tape drive to the Hard drive list.</p>
