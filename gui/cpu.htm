    <p>These settings control the type of Motorola 680x0 CPU which
    will be emulated.</p><img class="center" src="cpu.png" alt=
    "CPU">
    <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>68000</strong> is the basic CPU type, as found in
      the Amiga 500, 1000, and 2000 models.</li>
      <li><strong>68010</strong> is a slightly more advanced 68K
      member, but never actually shipped in a real Amiga.</li>
      <li><strong>68020</strong> is a much more advanced 68K CPU,
      with some new instructions, and a fully 32-bit engine. Used
      in the A2500 for brief period on the A2520 card. If 24 bit
      addressing is enabled, it is the same as th 68EC020 chip in
      the A1200.</li>
      <li><strong>68030</strong> This is a mid range CPU used in
      the A3000 and low end A4000s.</li>
      <li><strong>68040</strong> is the top CPU provided with the
      A4000 desktop computer</li>
      <li><strong>68060</strong> is the top end CPU mainly provided
      on accelerator cards and the A4000T. It requires the
      68060.library installed before using.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>24 bit addressing</strong> is used mainly by the
    <strong>68EC020</strong> CPU such as the A1200.</p>
    <p><strong>More compatible</strong> is only available when the
    CPU type is a <strong>68000</strong>. Some games and demos
    require this setting for proper compatibility.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Data cache emulation</strong> Besides
    the instruction cache, you can also emulate the data cache on
    the CPU.</p>
    <p><strong>JIT</strong> can be enabled to access the Advanced
    JIT settings if the 68030 or better is selected (See
    below).</p>
    <p><strong>68040 MMU</strong> enables the Memory Management
    Unit of the 68040 for operating systems like Linux on the
    Amiga. It is not compatible with JIT.</p>
    <p><strong>Unimplemented CPU emu</strong> emulates the full
    68060 CPU (in case you forget to load Setpatch and
    68040.library and 68060.library).</p>
    <h2>FPU (Floating Point Unit)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong> No FPU is provided, this is the
      only option for the 68000 and 68010.</li>
      <li><strong>68881</strong> Can be specified with the 68020
      and 68030.</li>
      <li><strong>68882</strong> Can be specified with the 68020
      and 68030.</li>
      <li><strong>CPU internal</strong> Can be specified for the
      68040 and 68060.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>More Compatible</strong> is available if a FPU is
    selected. Some applications require this for proper
    compatibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Unimplemented FPU emu</strong> emulates the full
    68881 FPU (in case you forget to load Setpatch and
    68040.library and 68060.library).</p>
    <p><strong>Softfloat FPU emulation</strong> emulates a software
    version of the FPU.</p>
    <h2>Cycle-Exact CPU Emulation Speed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CPU Frequency</strong> Set CPU frequency
      here.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PPC CPU Settings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PPC CPU Emulation (Blizzard PPC / Cyperstorm
      PPC)</strong>. Enables Power (PPC) CPU emulation using
      Blizzard PPC used on a A1200 or Cyberstorm PPC on an
      A4000.</li>
      <p>The <a href=
      "http://www.bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=154">
      Blizzard PPC</a> has a 68040/060 and PowerPC 603e at 160, 200
      or 240MHz with upto 256 MB RAM. The <a href=
      "http://www.bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=265">
      Cyberstorm PPC</a> has a 68040/060 and a PowerPC 604e at 150,
      180 or 200 Mhz with upto 128MB RAM. A seperate <a href=
      "http://www.winuae.net/frames/download.html">qemu-uae.dll</a>
      file in plugins folder is required for PPC emulation using
      QEmu.</p>
      <li><strong>Stopped M68K CPU idle mode</strong>.</li>
      <p>Sets level of idle mode for the 680x0 processor.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>x86 Bridgeboard CPU options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CPU Speed</strong>. Speed set between 0 and 100%
      CPU speed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CPU Emulation Speed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fastest possible</strong> lets the CPU section of
      the emulation run as many cycles as possible, while still
      maintaining emulation of the custom-chips at the appropriate
      rate. It is important to keep sound and graphics
      synchronized, no matter how fast the PC is.</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate A500/A1200 or cycle exact</strong>
      limits the CPU emulation to run the same number of cycles per
      vertical-blank as a standard A500 or A1200 would. In other
      words, for every 50Hz refresh of the graphics, the same
      number of CPU instructions will be executed as on a real A500
      or A1200 computer.</li>
      <li><strong>CPU Speed</strong> lets you tweak the balance of
      power between custom-chip emulation, and CPU speed. Some
      games and demos require this setting to be adjusted. This
      setting is the only CPU setting which can be changed once
      WinUAE is running.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>CPU Idle</strong> You can adjust the idle status of
    the CPU with this slider. This feature can be useful on
    notebooks to keep the CPU cooler. See the <a href=
    "../tips/generaltips.htm">Hints For Power Users</a> page.</p>
    <h2>JIT (Just in time) Settings</h2>
    <p>Due to the importance of the JIT engine and its complexity,
    it has its own <a href="../emulation/jit.htm">page</a> where
    you will find a description of its possibilities.</p>
