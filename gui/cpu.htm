<p class="headline1">CPU Settings</p>
<p class="text">These settings control the type of Motorola 68000 CPU which will
  be emulated.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="cpu.gif" alt="Winuae - CPU"></p>
<p class="headline2">CPU Type</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>68000</strong> is the basic CPU type, as found in
    the Amiga 500, 1000, and 2000 models.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68010</strong> is a slightly more advanced 68K member,
    but never actually shipped in a real Amiga.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68EC020</strong> is the same as a 68020 CPU, but with
    only 24 address-lines. This is the CPU used in the Amiga 1200 model.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68EC020+FPU</strong> is the same as a 68020 CPU, but
    with only 24 address-lines. This is the CPU used in the Amiga 1200 model,
    and does not allow for any Zorro-III expansion cards in the system. Because
    WinUAE uses virtual Zorro-III expansion cards to provide Picasso96 RTG support,
    no Picasso96 support is possible with this CPU type.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68020</strong> is a much more advanced 68K CPU, with
    some new instructions, and a fully 32-bit engine. Used in the A2500 for brief
    period on the A2520 card.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68020+FPU</strong> is similar to the above CPU type,
    but has a FPU.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68040</strong> can be enabled since the JIT patches
    were added to WinUAE.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><strong>More compatible</strong> is only available when the CPU type is a <strong>68000</strong>.
  Some games and demos require this setting for proper compatibility.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>JIT</strong> can be enabled to access the Advanced JIT settings (See
  below).</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">CPU Emulation Speed</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Fastest possible</strong> lets the CPU section of
    the emulation run as many cycles as possible, while still maintaining emulation
    of the custom-chips at the appropriate rate. It is important to keep sound
    and graphics synchronized, no matter how fast the PC is.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Match A500 speed</strong> limits the CPU emulation
    to run the same number of cycles per vertical-blank as a standard A500 would.
    In other words, for every 50Hz refresh of the graphics, the same number of
    CPU instructions will be executed as on a real A500 computer.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Adjustable between CPU and chipset</strong> lets you
    tweak the balance of power between custom-chip emulation, and CPU speed.
    Some games and demos require this setting to be adjusted. This setting is
    the only CPU setting which can be changed once WinUAE is running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><strong>CPU Idle </strong>You can adjust the idle status of the CPU with this
  slider.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">JIT Settings</p>
<p class="text">Due to the importance of the JIT engine and its complexity, it has its own <a href="../emulation/jit.htm">page</a> where
  you will find a description of its possibilities.</p>
