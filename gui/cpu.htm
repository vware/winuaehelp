  <p class="normal">These settings control the type of Motorola 680x0 CPU which will 
    be emulated.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="cpu.gif" alt="Winuae - CPU"></p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">CPU Type</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68000</strong> is the basic CPU type, as found in the 
      Amiga 500, 1000, and 2000 models.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68010</strong> is a slightly more advanced 68K member, 
      but never actually shipped in a real Amiga.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68020</strong> is a much more advanced 68K CPU, with 
      some new instructions, and a fully 32-bit engine. Used in the A2500 for brief 
      period on the A2520 card. If 24 bit addressing is enabled, it is the same 
      as th 68EC020 chip in the A1200.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68030</strong> This is a mid range CPU used in the 
      A3000 and low end A4000s.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68040</strong> is the top CPU provided with the A4000 
      desktop computer</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68060 </strong>is the top end CPU mainly provided on 
      accelerator cards and the A4000T. It requires the 68060.library installed 
      before using.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal"><strong>24 bit addressing</strong> is used mainly by the <strong>68EC020 </strong>CPU 
    such as the A1200.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>More compatible</strong> is only available when the CPU 
    type is a <strong>68000</strong>. Some games and demos require this setting 
    for proper compatibility.</p>
  <p class="normal"><strong>JIT</strong> can be enabled to access the Advanced JIT 
    settings if the 68030 or better is selected (See below).</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">FPU</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><strong>None.</strong> No FPU is provided, this is the only 
      option for the 68000 and 68010.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68881.</strong> Can be specified with the 68020 and 
      68030.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>68882.</strong> Can be specified with the 68020 and 
      68030.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>CPU internal.</strong> Can be specified for the 68040 
      and 68060.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal"><strong>More Compatible</strong> is available if a FPU is selected. 
    Some applications require this for proper compatibility.</p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">CPU Emulation Speed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Fastest possible</strong> lets the CPU section of
      the emulation run as many cycles as possible, while still maintaining emulation
      of the custom-chips at the appropriate rate. It is important to keep sound
      and graphics synchronized, no matter how fast the PC is.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Match A500 speed</strong> limits the CPU emulation
      to run the same number of cycles per vertical-blank as a standard A500 would.
      In other words, for every 50Hz refresh of the graphics, the same number of
      CPU instructions will be executed as on a real A500 computer.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Adjustable between CPU and chipset</strong> lets you
      tweak the balance of power between custom-chip emulation, and CPU speed.
      Some games and demos require this setting to be adjusted. This setting is
      the only CPU setting which can be changed once WinUAE is running.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal"><strong>CPU Idle </strong>You can adjust the idle status of the
    CPU with this slider. This feature can be useful on notebooks to keep the
    CPU cooler. See the <a href="../tips/generaltips.htm">Hints For Power Users</a> page. </p>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">JIT Settings</h2>
  <p class="normal">Due to the importance of the JIT engine and its complexity, it has its own <a href="../emulation/jit.htm">page</a> where
    you will find a description of its possibilities.</p>
