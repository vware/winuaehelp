    <p>This tab contains some very important and complex options,
    please make sure to read the <a href=
    "../emulation/drives.htm">Drive Emulation</a> page for
    details!</p><img class="center" src="HDD.png" alt=
    "WinUAE - Hard Drives">
    <h1>Add Directory or Archive..</h1><img class="center" src=
    "harddirectory.png" alt="WinUAE - Add Directory">
    <p>Adds a directory or an archive on the host as virtual HDD to
    the Amiga. You can specify a path to your desired folder in
    Windows, set a Volume and a Device name.<br>
    Use <strong>Select Archive or plain file</strong> to add an
    archive file (.zip, .7z, .rar, .lha, .lzh, .lzx) to appear as a
    disk on Workbench so there is no need to extract the files
    first.</p>
    <h1>Add Hardfile...</h1><img class="center" src="hardfile.png"
    alt="Add Hardfile" height="479">
    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>Add a hardfile; if you want to use an existing file, just
    click the ... button opposite <strong>Path</strong> and select
    the hdf file. If you want to add a new file, skip over to "New
    hard disk image file".<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HD Controller</strong> changes which controller to use
    such as <strong>UAE, IDE, SCSI, PCMCIA SRAM or
    IDE</strong>.<br>
    Once you have selected a hardfile, it will display details
    about the cylinders, blocks, size and DOS type in the box.<br>
    Settings:<br>
    <strong>Full drive/RDB mode</strong> enables Rigid Disk Block
    mode, this stores the partition and file system information in
    a special block of disk (similar to the Master Boot Record on
    PCs).</p>
    <h2>New hard disk image file</h2>
    <p><strong>RDB/OFS/FFS</strong> - Set file system to Rigid Disk
    Block mode, Original File System (WB 1.3) or Fast File System
    (WB 2.x, 3.x). Newer file systems include PFS3 (Professional
    Filing System), PDS3, SFS (Smart File System) and Custom file
    system.<br>
    <strong>DOS type -</strong> Displays the file system name in
    Hexadecimal format.<br>
    <strong>Sparse file</strong> - Formats disk file as a file
    which attempts to use disk space more efficiently when it is
    mostly empty by using metadata to represent empty space.<br>
    <strong>Dynamic HDF</strong> - Modern disk file format which
    expands as more data is added to the disk file, minimizes disk
    usage like Dynamic VHD files on PC.</p>
    <h1>Add Hard Drive...</h1><img class="center" src=
    "harddrive.png" alt="Hard Drive Settings">
    <p>It is also possible to add actual, full hard drives to
    WinUAE. The drop down list will only show Amiga formatted
    drives, Amithlon partitions and empty partitions (no Windows
    partitions). Tick the <strong>Read/Write</strong> option if you
    wish to read and write to such a partition. The boxes below
    will display details about the hard drive selected, such as
    size.<br>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Administrator rights are required for
    this feature!</p>
    <h1>Add SCSI/IDE Tape Drive...</h1><img class="center" src=
    "tapedrive.png" alt="WinUAE - Tape Drive">
    <p>Select a Path to a folder where data can be read or written
    to. It will work with Amix and any backup software that
    requires a tape drive.<br>
    <strong>Select directory</strong> Browse for an directory on
    hard disk to emulate tape drive.<br>
    <strong>Select archive or plain file</strong> Browse for an
    archive or normal backup file.<br>
    <strong>Eject</strong> Remove the tape from the drive.<br>
    <strong>HD Controller</strong>Specify controller to emulate
    e.g. UAE, IDE, SCSI, PCMCIA SRAM, PCMCIA IDE.<br>
    <strong>Read / write</strong> Enable read and write mode for
    tape drive otherwise it will use Read only mode.<br>
    <strong>Add Tape Drive</strong> will add the new emulated tape
    drive to the Hard drive list.</p>
    <h1>Options</h1>
    <p><strong>Add PC Drives at Startup</strong> mounts all
    available fixed drives for the Amiga to use<br>
    <strong>Include removable drives</strong> also mounts all
    removable drives, such as CD-ROM, USB drives, SD cards<br>
    <strong>Include network drives</strong> also mounts all mapped
    network drives<br>
    <strong>Disable CDFS automount CD/DVD drives</strong> will
    disable mounting compact discs and DVDS without having to
    install a CD file system<br>
    <strong>Disable UAEFSDB Support</strong> disable creating
    UAEFSDB files when a directory is mounted as drive<br>
    <strong>Don't use Windows Recycle Bin</strong> - Excludes
    Windows Recycle Bin from emulation.<br>
    <strong>Automount Removable drives</strong> will mount a
    removable drive such as soon as the media is inserted<br>
    <strong>Limit size of directory drives to 1GB</strong> will do
    just that</p>
    <h1>Optical media options</h1>
    <p>Similar to virtual floppies, a CD image can be inserted or
    injected in this section.<br>
    <strong>CDTV/CDTV-CR/CD32 turbo CD read speed</strong> will
    emulate the CD drive at maximum speed</p>
