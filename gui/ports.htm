    port emulations work.</p><img class="center" src="io.png" alt=
    "Game and I/O Ports">
    <h2>Parallel</h2>
    <p>This lets you specify which PC installed printer you want to
    use for printing for the "Amiga".<br>
    Type can be ASCII-Only for text only printing.<br>
    Type can be Epson Matrix Printer Emulation for older dot matrix
    type printers.<br>
    The Postscript (Passthrough) can be used if the printer
    supports the postscript language (usually laser printers).<br>
    The Postscript printer emulator will use <a href=
    "http://aminet.net/search?query=ghostscript">Ghostscript</a>
    program which will work with any Windows printer.<br>
    Ghostscript extra parameters. Specify extra options for
    Ghostscript program.<br>
    The Parallel Audio Sampler port can be None or DSound.</p>
    <h2>Serial</h2>
    <p>You can adjust the serial port (COM1....) to be used as
    serial port within UAE. All ports including virtual ports on
    your PC are selectable.</p>
    <p><strong>RTS/CTS</strong> handshaking can be enabled if its
    required for modems etc. If <strong>Direct</strong> is enabled
    then it will fix PC to PC Lotus 2 serial link problems when
    using serial port.</p>
    <p><strong>uaeserial.device</strong> is available for access to
    different types of serial ports if a program requires it
    including multiple ports and unit numbers.</p>
    <h2>MIDI In/Out</h2>
    <p>Here you can select the MIDI - device(s) to be used. Only
    available when the Serial- emulation is enabled.<br>
    In Vista, you may not get a MIDI In device to use.</p>

    <p>Here you can select which game dongle to use including:
    None, Robocop 3, Leaderboard, B.A.T.II, Italy '90 Soccer, Dames
    Grand Maitre, Rugby Coach, Cricket Captain, Leviathan.</p>
