<p class="headline1">Sound</p>
<p class="text">Here you can select, if (and how) UAE will provide sound emulation.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="sound.gif" alt="WinUAE - Sound"></p>
<p class="text"><strong>Sound device:</strong> Specify which sound card to use
  on your system.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Sound Emulation</p>
<ul>
<li class="text"><strong>Disabled</strong> causes UAE not to emulate sound.</li>
<li class="text"><strong>Disabled, but emulated</strong> tries to emulate most of the sound
  hardware, but doesn't actually output sound.</li>
<li class="text"><strong>Emulated</strong> should sound just as good as 100% accurate and will
  be much faster for some programs.</li>
<li class="text"><strong>Emulated, 100% accurate</strong> will emulate all of the sound hardware;
  and some programs (i.e. AIBB) won't run with other settings.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Disk Drive Sound Emulation</p>
<p class="text">This feature enables the Disk Drive sounds like on a real Amiga
  so you can hear disks being read or written to. Select a drive and the Amiga
  emulation mode to use (A500 by default). The slider is the volume.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Frequency, Sample Type and Stereo Mode</p>
<p class="text">This options allow you to adjust the settings for the sound-sampling.
  The higher Frequency and/or Sample Type, the higher will be the sound quality,
  but the slower will be the emulation. The <strong>Stereo mode</strong> can
  be set to Mono, Stereo or Mixed (either). Stereo will use more CPU time.</p>
<p class="text">The <strong>Audio Filter</strong> allows you to emulate Sound
  Power LED and can be Always on, Always off or Emulated.<br>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> High quality sound requires a lot of computing power,
  so try with different settings if your machine is not fast enough.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Sound Buffering</p>
<p class="text">Gives you access to the level of the used Direct Sound buffer.
  You should play with it if you get choppy sound. <br>
  Values can be from 1 to 7. <br>
  Also, you can set <strong>Interpolation</strong> on to smooth out sound but
  needs more computing power. <br>
  Finally, you can compensate for 'sound lag' when sound becomes unsynchronised
  with the system by adjusting the <strong>Sound driver lag compensation </strong>from
  -10% to +3%.<br>
  The <strong>Calibrate </strong>button will optimise the sound values for you
  to match your PC.</p>
<p class="text">Two new settings for <strong>Stereo Seperation and Stereo mixing
    delay</strong> can be set to improve stereo sound.</p>
