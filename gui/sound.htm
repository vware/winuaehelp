    <p>Here you can select, if (and how) UAE will provide sound
    emulation.</p><img class="center" src="sound.png" alt=
    "WinUAE - Sound">
    <p><strong>Sound device</strong> drop down menu to select which
    host sound card to use</p>
    <h1>Sound Emulation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> causes UAE not to emulate
      sound.</li>
      <li><strong>Disabled, but emulated</strong> tries to emulate
      most of the sound hardware, but doesn't actually output
      sound.</li>
      <li><strong>Enabled</strong> will emulate all of the sound
      hardware, and some programs won't work with other
      settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Automatic switching</strong> allows switching
    between sound modes automatically.<br>
    <strong>Include CD and FMV audio</strong> enables audio from CD
    and video sources</p>
    <h1>Volume</h1>
    <p><strong>Master volume</strong>. Set overall volume between
    0% (silent) to 100% (loud).<br>
    <strong>Paula,CD,AHI Audio</strong>. Set audio from either
    Paula, direct CD or AHI sound between 0% (silent) to 100%
    (loud).</p>
    <h1>Sound Buffer Size</h1>
    <p>Gives access to the level of the used Direct Sound buffer.
    If sound output is choppy, this should be changed.</p>
    <h1>Settings</h1>
    <p><strong>Channel mode</strong> can be set to Mono, Stereo,
    Cloned Stereo or 4 Channel. Stereo will use more CPU time.<br>
    <strong>Stereo Separation</strong> can be set to improve stereo
    sound.<br>
    <strong>Interpolation</strong> improved quality by smoothing
    calculation results, but needs more computing power.<br>
    <strong>Frequency</strong> higher Frequency and/or Sample Type,
    the higher the sound quality will be, but the slower the
    emulation <strong>Swap channels</strong> can be used to swap
    between channels for Paula, AHI or both types of Sound
    chipsets.<br>
    <strong>Stereo delay</strong> can be set to improve stereo
    sound.<br>
    <strong>Audio Filter</strong> allows you to emulate Sound Power
    LED and can be Always on, Always off or Emulated.</p>
    <h1>Floppy Drive Sound Emulation</h1>
    <p>This feature enables the Disk Drive sounds like on a real
    Amiga so you can hear disks being read or written to. Select a
    drive and the Amiga emulation mode to use (A500 by default).
    The sliders are the volume controls.</p>
    <h1>Drivers</h1>
    <p>You can enable which host sound drivers you can use to
    ensure sound works such as <strong>DirectSound, WASAPI (Windows
    Audio Session API), OpenAL, PortAudio</strong>.</p>
