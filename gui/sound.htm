    <p>Here you can select, if (and how) UAE will provide sound
    emulation.</p><img class="center" src="sound.png" alt=
    "WinUAE - Sound">
    <p><strong>Sound device:</strong> Specify which sound card to
    use on your system.</p>
    <h2>Sound Emulation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disabled</strong> causes UAE not to emulate
      sound.</li>
      <li><strong>Disabled, but emulated</strong> tries to emulate
      most of the sound hardware, but doesn't actually output
      sound.</li>
      <li><strong>Emulated</strong> should sound just as good as
      100% accurate and will be much faster for some programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Emulated, 100% accurate</strong> will emulate all
      of the sound hardware; and some programs (i.e. AIBB) won't
      run with other settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatic switching.</strong> Allow switching
      between sound modes automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Volume settings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Master volume</strong>. Set overall volume
      between 0% (silent) to 100% (loud).</li>
      <li><strong>Paula,CD,AHI Audio</strong>. Set audio from
      either Paula, direct CD or AHI sound between 0% (silent) to
      100% (loud).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Floppy Drive Sound Emulation</h2>
    <p>This feature enables the Disk Drive sounds like on a real
    Amiga so you can hear disks being read or written to. Select a
    drive and the Amiga emulation mode to use (A500 by default).
    The sliders are the volume controls.</p>
    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <p>This options allow you to adjust the settings for the
    sound-sampling. The higher Frequency and/or Sample Type, the
    higher will be the sound quality, but the slower will be the
    emulation. The <strong>Stereo mode</strong> can be set to Mono,
    Stereo, Cloned Stereo or 4 Channel. Stereo will use more CPU
    time.</p>
    <p>Two new settings for <strong>Stereo Separation and Stereo
    mixing delay</strong> can be set to improve stereo sound.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Audio Filter</strong> allows you to emulate
    Sound Power LED and can be Always on, Always off or
    Emulated.<br>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> High quality sound requires a lot of
    computing power, so try with different settings if your machine
    is not fast enough.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Swap Channels</strong> can be used to swap
    between channels for Paula, AHI or both types of Sound
    chipsets.</p>
    <h2>Sound Buffering</h2>
    <p>Gives you access to the level of the used Direct Sound
    buffer. You should play with it if you get choppy sound.<br>
    Values can be from 1 to 7.<br>
    Also, you can set <strong>Interpolation</strong> on to smooth
    out sound but needs more computing power.<br>
    The <strong>Calibrate</strong> button will optimize the sound
    values for you to match your PC.</p>
    <h2>Drivers</h2>
    <p>You can enable which host sound drivers you can use to
    ensure sound works such as <strong>DirectSound, WASAPI (Windows
    Audio Session) API, OpenAL (Open Audio Library)</strong> and
    <strong>PortAudio</strong>.</p>
