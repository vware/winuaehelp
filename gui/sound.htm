  <p>Here you can select, if (and how) UAE will provide sound emulation.</p>
  <img class="center" src="sound.png" alt="WinUAE - Sound">
  <p><strong>Sound device:</strong> Specify which sound card to use
    on your system.</p>
  <h2>Sound Emulation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Disabled</strong> causes UAE not to emulate sound.</li>
    <li><strong>Disabled, but emulated</strong> tries to emulate most 
      of the sound hardware, but doesn't actually output sound.</li>
    <li><strong>Emulated</strong> should sound just as good as 100% 
      accurate and will be much faster for some programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Emulated, 100% accurate</strong> will emulate all of 
      the sound hardware; and some programs (i.e. AIBB) won't run with other settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic switching.</strong> Allow switching between 
      sound modes automatically.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Volume settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Master volume</strong>. Set overall volume between 0% (silent) to 100% (loud).</li>
    <li><strong>Paula,CD,AHI Audio</strong>. Set audio from either Paula, direct CD or AHI sound between 0% (silent) to 100% (loud).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Floppy Drive Sound Emulation</h2>
  <p>This feature enables the Disk Drive sounds like on a real Amiga 
    so you can hear disks being read or written to. Select a drive and the Amiga 
    emulation mode to use (A500 by default). The sliders are the volume controls.</p>
  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <p>This options allow you to adjust the settings for the sound-sampling. 
    The higher Frequency and/or Sample Type, the higher will be the sound quality, 
    but the slower will be the emulation. The <strong>Stereo mode</strong> can be 
    set to Mono, Stereo, Cloned Stereo or 4 Channel. Stereo will use more CPU time.</p>
  <p>Two new settings for <strong>Stereo Seperation and Stereo mixing 
    delay</strong> can be set to improve stereo sound.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Audio Filter</strong> allows you to emulate Sound 
    Power LED and can be Always on, Always off or Emulated.<br />
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> High quality sound requires a lot of computing power, 
    so try with different settings if your machine is not fast enough.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Swap Channels</strong> can be used to swap between channels 
    for Paula, AHI or both types of Sound chipsets.</p>
  <h2>Sound Buffering</h2>
  <p>Gives you access to the level of the used Direct Sound buffer. 
    You should play with it if you get choppy sound. <br />
    Values can be from 1 to 7. <br />
    Also, you can set <strong>Interpolation</strong> on to smooth out sound but 
    needs more computing power. <br />
    The <strong>Calibrate</strong> button will optimise the sound values for you 
    to match your PC.</p>
  <h2>Drivers</h2>
  <p>You can enable which host sound drivers you can use to ensure sound works such as <strong>DirectSound, WASAPI (Windows Audio Session) API, OpenAL (Open Audio Library)</strong> and <strong>PortAudio</strong>.</p>
