    <p>These settings allow you to manage config-files (which have
    the extension .uae). These files have both a name and
    description, and control the behavior of WinUAE. Basically, a
    configuration file is an encapsulation of the settings found on
    all the other pages in the GUI.</p><img class="center" src=
    "config.png" alt="WinUAE - Configurations">
    <p>You can load a configuration by selecting it from the list
    and then clicking the Load button, or by double-clicking a
    configuration in the list. You can use the Load from button to
    load a configuration from a different location on the hard
    disk.<br>
    Additionally, you can double-click any .uae config-file from
    the Windows Explorer, or from a Desktop Shortcut. The
    configuration will load, and if the <a href="misc.htm">Show GUI
    on Startup</a> setting is disabled, WinUAE will immediately
    launch into emulation-mode, bypassing the GUI completely.<br>
    To save your changes for a configuration which you've loaded,
    simply press the Save button. If you've made changes to a
    configuration and want to save it under a different name,
    simply change the Name field on this page of the GUI or select
    Save As. You can also adjust the Description field.<br>
    Select a configuration from the list, and click the Delete
    button.</p>
