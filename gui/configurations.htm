    <p>These settings allow you to manage config-files (which have
    the extension .uae). These files have both a name and
    description, and control the behavior of WinUAE. Basically, a
    configuration file is an encapsulation of the settings found on
    all the other pages in the GUI.</p><img class="center" src=
    "config.png" alt="WinUAE - Configurations">
    <p>You can load a configuration by selecting it from the list,
    perform a <strong>Search</strong> or use a
    <strong>Filter</strong> and then clicking the
    <strong>Load</strong> button, or by double-clicking a
    configuration in the list. You can use the <strong>Load
    from</strong> button to load a configuration from a different
    location on the hard disk. Click <strong>Start</strong> to
    begin the emulation.<br>
    Additionally, you can double-click any .uae config-file from
    the Windows Explorer, or from a Desktop Shortcut. The
    configuration will load, and if the <a href="misc.htm">Show GUI
    on Startup</a> setting is disabled, WinUAE will immediately
    launch into emulation-mode, bypassing the GUI completely.<br>
    If you have a lot of configurations, you can use the Search or
    Filter boxes to list the required configurations you want to
    use.<br>
    To save your changes for a configuration which you've loaded,
    simply press the <strong>Save</strong> button. If you've made
    changes to a configuration and want to save it under a
    different name, simply change the Name field on this page of
    the GUI or select <strong>Save As</strong>. You can also adjust
    the Description field.<br>
    To remove an old configuration, select a configuration from the
    list, and click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
