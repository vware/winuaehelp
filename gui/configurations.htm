  <p>These settings allow you to manage config-files (which have the extension
    .uae). These config-files have both a name and description, and control the
    behaviour of WinUAE. Basically, a config-file is an encapsulation of the settings
    found on all the other pages in the GUI.</p>

  <h2>Loading a Configuration</h2>
  <p>You can load a configuration by selecting it from the list and
    then clicking the Load button, or by double-clicking a configuration in the
    list. You can use the Load From button to load a configuration from a different
    location on the hard disk.</p>
  <p>Additionally, you can double-click any .uae config-file from
    the Windows Explorer, or from a Desktop Shortcut. The configuration will load,
    and if the <a href="misc.htm">Show GUI on Startup</a> setting is disabled,
    WinUAE will immediately launch into emulation-mode, bypassing the GUI completely.</p>
  <h2>Saving a Configuration</h2>
  <p>To save your changes for a configuration which you've loaded, simply press
    the Save button. If you've made changes to a configuration and want to save
    it under a different name, simply change the Name field on this page of the
    GUI or select Save As. You can also adjust the Description field.</p>
  <p>If you upgrade your version of WinUAE, it is best to delete or update your
    current configuration for the new version of WinUAE to use the new features!</p>
  <h2>Deleting a Configuration</h2>
  <p>Select a configuration from the list, and click the Delete button.</p>
  <h2>Exiting WinUAE</h2>
  <p>Select <strong>Quit</strong> or click on the X in the Window.</p>
  <h2>Resetting Amiga</h2>
  <p>Select <strong>Reset</strong> to restart the Amiga (equivalent to Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga keys).</p>
