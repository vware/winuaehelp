    <p>This will select which custom chipset to use for
    emulation:</p><img class="center" src="chipset.png" alt=
    "Winuae - Chipset">
    <h2>Chipset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the
      first Chipset, used in the Amiga 1000. It consists of the
      chips Paula, Agnus, and Denise. With these, you can display
      graphics in resolutions up to 640x512 and in up to 4096
      colors.</li>
      <li><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which
      supplies 1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
      <li><strong>Full ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was
      the next generation of Amiga chipsets. The chip names
      remained unchanged, except some minor additions like "Fat
      Agnus". Only Agnus and Denise were changed. Compared to OCS,
      they provided higher resolutions, but no expansion of the
      color palette so far.</li>
      <li><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture):
      This is the latest and most advanced chipset. The current
      generation was created in the labs as AA chipset (for
      Advanced Amiga), but in some countries it was later marketed
      as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture). Agnus was replaced
      by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The resolutions now reach up to
      1280x512 in VGA scan frequencies. The color palette is now 24
      bits or 16.8 million colors. You can display up to 256 colors
      simultaneously or in HAM mode more than 640,000. Backwards
      compatibility with Video and OCS modes is assured.<br>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color
      depth screen modes!</li>
      <li><strong>ECS Denise</strong> Use the new ECS display modes
      with Denise Chip.</li>
      <li><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode
      (default is PAL).</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle-exact</strong> Enables cycle exact chipsets
      as the real hardware for some games.</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle-exact (DMA/Memory accesses).</strong>
      Enables cycle exact chipsets just for Direct Memory Accesses
      or normal memory accesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Chipset extra:</strong> List of Amiga models to
      choose to select appropriate chipset automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate Blitter</strong> Does requested blits
      immediately. The Blitter serves to provide extremely fast,
      animated graphics that can be designed to be especially
      realistic.</li>
      <li><strong>Wait for Blitter</strong>. Wait for blitter to
      complete operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Genlock Connected</strong> Detects whether a
      Genlock is connected to PC.</li>
      <li><strong>Genlock emulation mode.</strong> Selection of
      Noise or Test Card with 0-100% emulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Video port display hardware.</strong> Selection
      of Autodetect, A2024, Graffiti, Black Belt systems HAM-E,
      Newtronic video, Archos AVideo, Impulse Firecracker or
      Digital Creations DCTV.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Collision Level</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
      sprites only enabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong>
      Collison detection between Sprites and background
      graphics.</li>
      <li><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision
      detection.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it
      causes unnecessary performance loss, and is just very rarely
      needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Genlock</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genlock connected</strong> Specifies whether a
      Genlock (generator locking) device is connected. A Genlock is
      used where the video output of one source, or a specific
      reference signal from a signal generator, is used to
      synchronise other television picture sources together.</li>
      <li><strong>Genlock type</strong> Specified type of Genlock:
      Noise, Test card, image file, Video file, Capture device,
      American Laser Games LaserDisc Player.</li>
      <li><strong>Percentage</strong> of lock between sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Include alpha channel in screenshots and video
      captures.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Keep aspect ratio</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Genlock file</strong> Image file or video file to
      use.</li>
    </ul>
