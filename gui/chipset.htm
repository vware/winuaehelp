    <p>This will select which custom chipset to use for
    emulation:</p><img class="center" src="chipset.png" alt=
    "WinUAE - Chipset">
    <h2>Chipset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the
      first chipset, used in the Amiga 1000.</li>
      <li><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which
      supplies 1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
      <li><strong>Full ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was
      the next generation of Amiga chipsets. Compared to OCS, they
      provided higher resolutions, but no expansion of the color
      palette.</li>
      <li><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture):
      This is the latest and most advanced chipset.<br>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color
      depth screen modes!</li>
      <li><strong>ECS Denise</strong> Use the new ECS display modes
      with Denise Chip.</li>
      <li><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode
      (default is PAL).</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle-exact</strong> Enables cycle exact chipsets
      as the real hardware for some games.</li>
      <li><strong>Cycle-exact (DMA/Memory accesses).</strong>
      Enables cycle exact chipsets just for Direct Memory Accesses
      or normal memory accesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Chipset extra:</strong> List of Amiga models to
      choose to select appropriate chipset automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information about Amiga custom chipsets, please
    check the <a href="../background/custchips.htm">Custom
    Chips</a> section.</p>
    <h2>Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate Blitter</strong> Does requested blits
      immediately. The Blitter serves to provide extremely fast,
      animated graphics that can be designed to be especially
      realistic.</li>
      <li><strong>Wait for Blitter</strong>. Wait for the Blitter
      to complete operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Genlock Connected</strong> Detects whether a
      Genlock is connected to PC.</li>
      <li><strong>Genlock emulation mode.</strong> Selection of
      Noise or Test Card with 0-100% emulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Video port display hardware.</strong> Selection
      of Autodetect, A2024, Graffiti, Black Belt systems HAM-E,
      Newtronic video, Archos AVideo, Impulse Firecracker or
      Digital Creations DCTV.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Collision Level</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
      sprites only enabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong>
      Collison detection between Sprites and background
      graphics.</li>
      <li><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision
      detection.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it
      causes unnecessary performance loss, and is just very rarely
      needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Genlock</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genlock connected</strong> Specifies whether a
      Genlock (generator locking) device is connected. A Genlock is
      used where the video output of one source, or a specific
      reference signal from a signal generator, is used to
      synchronize other television picture sources together.</li>
      <li><strong>Genlock type</strong> Specified type of Genlock:
      Noise, Test card, image file, Video file, Capture device,
      American Laser Games LaserDisc Player.</li>
      <li><strong>Percentage</strong> of lock between sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Include alpha channel in screenshots and video
      captures.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Keep aspect ratio</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Genlock file</strong> Image file or video file to
      use.</li>
    </ul>
