<p class="text">This will select which custom chipset to use for emulation:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="chipset.gif" alt="Winuae - Chipset"></p>
<p class="headline2">Chipset type</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the first
    Chipset, used in the Amiga 1000. It consists of the chips Paula, Agnus, and
    Denise. With these, you can display graphics in resolutions up to 640x512
    and in up to 4096 colors. </li>
  <li class="text"><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which supplies
    1Mb of Chip RAM.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Full ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was the
    next generation of Amiga chipsets. The chip names remained unchanged, except
    some minor additions like &quot;Fat Agnus&quot;. Only Agnus and Denise were
    changed. Compared to OCS, they provided higher resolutions, but no expansion
    of the color palette so far.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture): This
    is the latest and most advanced chipset. The current generation was created
    in the labs as AA chipset (for Advanced Amiga), but in some countries it
    was later marketed as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture). Agnus was replaced
    by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The resolutions now reach up to 1280x512 in
    VGA scan frequencies. The color palette is now 24 bits or 16.8 million colors.
    You can display up to 256 colors simultaneously or in HAM mode more than
    640,000. Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS modes is assured.<br>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color depth screen
    modes!</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode (default
    is PAL).</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Misc chipset options</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Fast Copper</strong> is the short name for a &quot;Coprocessor&quot; which
    is integrated into the Amiga custom chips. It makes fast action games possible,
    as well as unbelievable color effects, and the capability to drag down a
    screen partially on the Amiga's display and thus show several screens at
    once. Technically, the Copper is a highly specialized microprocessor which
    knows only three different commands, but can process these extremely fast
    and efficiently. It provides the ability to change e.g. graphics mode, color
    values, or sprite definitions somewhere at a well defined location within
    the screen. This way the Amiga can display many different actions on one
    screen simultaneously without activity by the main CPU.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Immediate Blits</strong>. The Blitter is the short
    name for another graphics coprocessor which is part of the Amiga custom chips.
    With it you can copy rectangular image parts extremely fast to other areas.
    During this, you can take up to three source data areas and perform logical
    operations on them. This allows e.g. to define certain color values of the
    copied object as transparent, thus not modifying the destination area. As
    an add-on, the Blitter can also draw lines and fill areas fast. All in all
    it serves to provide extremely fast, animated graphics that can be designed
    to be especially realistic. </li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Cycle exact CPU and Blitter.</strong> This is an experimental
    feature to cycle exact cpu and blitter emulation mode. Is slower than normal
    mode.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Collision Level</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
    sprites only enabled.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong> Collison
    detection between Sprites and background graphics.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision detection.<br>
    <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it causes unnecessary
    performance loss, and is just very rarely needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Sound Emulation</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Disabled. </strong>No sound</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Emulated.</strong> Sound is emulated but not 100%
    accurate.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Emulated. 100% accurate.</strong> As accurate sound
    emulation as possible but my use up more CPU time<br>
    <br>
