    <h1>Chipset</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OCS</strong>: This was the first or original
      chipset, used in the Amiga 1000.</li>
      <li><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which
      supplies 1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
      <li><strong>Full ECS</strong>: This was the next generation
      of Amiga chipsets. Compared to OCS, they provided higher
      resolutions, but no expansion of the color palette.</li>
      <li><strong>AGA</strong>: This is the latest and most
      advanced chipset.<br>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color
      depth screen modes!</li>
      <li><strong>ECS Denise</strong> Use the new ECS display modes
      with Denise Chip.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode (default
    is PAL).<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Cycle-exact</strong> Enables cycle exact chipsets as
    the real hardware for some games.<br>
    <strong>Cycle-exact (DMA/Memory accesses).</strong> Enables
    cycle exact chipsets just for Direct Memory Accesses or normal
    memory accesses.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Chipset extra:</strong> List of Amiga models to choose
    to select appropriate chipset automatically.</p>
    <h1>Options</h1>
    <p><strong>Keyboard connected</strong> Sets whether a keyboard
    is connected to the machine<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Immediate Blitter</strong> Does requested blits
    immediately. The Blitter serves to provide extremely fast,
    animated graphics that can be designed to be especially
    realistic.<br>
    <strong>Wait for Blitter</strong>. Wait for the Blitter to
    complete operations.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Video port display hardware.</strong> Selection of
    Autodetect, A2024, Graffiti, Black Belt systems HAM-E,
    Newtronic video, Archos AVideo, Impulse Firecracker or Digital
    Creations DCTV.<br>
    <strong>Monitor.</strong> Multi-monitor selection (default: 1
    of 1-4).</p>
    <h1>Collision Level</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
      sprites only enabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong>
      Collision detection between Sprites and background
      graphics.</li>
      <li><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision
      detection.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it
      causes unnecessary performance loss, and it is just very
      rarely needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Genlock</h1>
    <p><strong>Genlock connected</strong> Specifies whether a
    Genlock (generator locking) device is connected. A Genlock is
    used where the video output of one source, or a specific
    reference signal from a signal generator, is used to
    synchronize other television picture sources together.<br>
    <strong>Genlock type</strong> Specified type of Genlock: Noise,
    Test card, image file, Video file, Capture device, American
    Laser Games LaserDisc Player.<br>
    <strong>Percentage</strong> of lock between sources.<br>
    <strong>Include alpha channel in screenshots and video
    captures.</strong><br>
    <strong>Keep aspect ratio</strong><br>
    <strong>Genlock file</strong> Image file or video file to
    use.</p>
