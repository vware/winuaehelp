  <h2 class="dtH2">Chipset</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the 
      first Chipset, used in the Amiga 1000. It consists of the chips Paula, Agnus, 
      and Denise. With these, you can display graphics in resolutions up to 640x512 
      and in up to 4096 colors. </li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which 
      supplies 1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Full ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was 
      the next generation of Amiga chipsets. The chip names remained unchanged, 
      except some minor additions like &quot;Fat Agnus&quot;. Only Agnus and Denise 
      were changed. Compared to OCS, they provided higher resolutions, but no 
      expansion of the color palette so far.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture): 
      This is the latest and most advanced chipset. The current generation was 
      created in the labs as AA chipset (for Advanced Amiga), but in some countries 
      it was later marketed as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture). Agnus was 
      replaced by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The resolutions now reach up to 1280x512 
      in VGA scan frequencies. The color palette is now 24 bits or 16.8 million 
      colors. You can display up to 256 colors simultaneously or in HAM mode more 
      than 640,000. Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS modes is assured.<br>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color depth screen 
      modes!</li>
    <li><strong>ECS Denise </strong>Use the new ECS display modes with Denise Chip.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode (default 
      is PAL).</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Cycle-exact </strong> Enables cycle exact chipsets as the real hardware for some games.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Cycle-exact (DMA/Memory accesses). </strong>Enables cycle exact chipsets just for Direct Memory Accesses or normal memory accesses.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Chipset extra: </strong>List of Amiga models to 
      choose to select appropriate chipset automatically.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Options</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Immediate Blitter</strong> Does requested blits immediately.
      The Blitter serves to provide extremely fast, animated graphics that can
      be designed to be especially realistic. </li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Wait for Blitter</strong>. Wait for blitter to complete operations.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Genlock Connected</strong> Detects whether a Genlock
      is connected to PC.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Genlock emulation mode. </strong>Selection of Noise or Test Card with 0-100% emulation.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Video port display hardware. </strong>Selection of Autodetect, A2024, Graffiti, Black Belt systems HAM-E, Newtronic video, Archos AVideo, Impulse Firecracker or Digital Creations DCTV.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Collision Level</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
      sprites only enabled.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong> Collison
      detection between Sprites and background graphics.</li>
    <li class="normal"><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision detection.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it causes unnecessary
      performance loss, and is just very rarely needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="dtH2">Genlock</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genlock connected</strong> Specifies whether a Genlock (generator locking) device is connected. A Genlock is used where the video output of one source, or a specific reference signal from a signal generator, is used to synchronise other television picture sources together.</li>
    <li><strong>Genlock type</strong> Specified type of Genlock: Noise, Test card, image file, Video file, Capture device, American Laser Games LaserDisc Player.</li>
    <li><strong>Percentage</strong> of lock between sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Include alpha channel in screenshots and video captures.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Keep aspect ratio</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Genlock file</strong> Image file or video file to use.</li>
  </ul>
