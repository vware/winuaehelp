<p align="center"><img src="chipset.gif" alt="Winuae - Chipset"></p>
<p class="headline2">Chipset type</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the first 
    Chipset, used in the Amiga 1000. It consists of the chips Paula, Agnus, and 
    Denise. With these, you can display graphics in resolutions up to 640x512 
    and in up to 4096 colors. </li>
  <li class="text"><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which supplies 
    1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Full ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was the 
    next generation of Amiga chipsets. The chip names remained unchanged, except 
    some minor additions like &quot;Fat Agnus&quot;. Only Agnus and Denise were 
    changed. Compared to OCS, they provided higher resolutions, but no expansion 
    of the color palette so far.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture): This 
    is the latest and most advanced chipset. The current generation was created 
    in the labs as AA chipset (for Advanced Amiga), but in some countries it was 
    later marketed as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture). Agnus was replaced 
    by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The resolutions now reach up to 1280x512 in VGA 
    scan frequencies. The color palette is now 24 bits or 16.8 million colors. 
    You can display up to 256 colors simultaneously or in HAM mode more than 640,000. 
    Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS modes is assured.<br>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color depth screen 
    modes!</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode (default 
    is PAL).</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Chipset extra: </strong>List of Amiga models to choose 
    to select appropiate chipset automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Misc chipset options</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Immediate Blitter</strong> Does requested blits immediately.
    The Blitter serves to provide extremely fast, animated graphics that can
    be designed to be especially realistic. </li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Cycle exact CPU and Blitter</strong> This is an experimental
    feature to cycle exact cpu and blitter emulation mode. This is slower than
    normal mode, and only necessary for a few games and demos.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Genlock Connected</strong> Detects whether a Genlock
    is connected to PC.</li>
  <li class="text">
    <p><strong>Faster RTG.</strong> Disables non needed emulation features such 
      as internal bitplace emulation and copper, when RTG (P96) is in use.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Collision Level</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
    sprites only enabled.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong> Collison
    detection between Sprites and background graphics.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision detection.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it causes unnecessary
    performance loss, and is just very rarely needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Sound Emulation</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Disabled. </strong>No sound</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Emulated.</strong> Sound is emulated but not 100%
    accurate.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Emulated, 100% accurate</strong> As accurate as possible
    but may use up more CPU time<br>
    <br>
