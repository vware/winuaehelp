    <p>The disk swapper mechanism is similar in concept to a
    playlist or a CD changer: up to 20 disk images can be added to
    a list for swapping them quickly.</p><img class="center" src=
    "diskswap.png" alt="WinUAE - Disk Swapper">
    <p>Double clicking on a line or selecting it and choosing
    <strong>Insert floppy disk image</strong> will bring up a file
    requester to add a ADF image to the list. All slots may be
    filled with images.<br>
    Clicking in the <strong>Drive</strong> column next to each
    entry will cycle through all enabled floppy drives. Once the
    disks have a drive name next to them, they will appear in the
    appropriate <a href="floppies.htm">Floppy Drives</a> slots.<br>
    <br>
    Selecting an entry and clicking <strong>Remove floppy disk
    image</strong> will remove the image from the list.<br>
    Use <strong>Remove all</strong> to remove all the images from
    the list.</p>
