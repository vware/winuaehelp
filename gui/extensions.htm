    <h1>When Active</h1>
    <p><strong>Run at priority</strong> Choose which priority
    WinUAE should have when it's window is active. Depending on
    which other programs are running on the host, this should be
    set to Normal or higher.</p>
    <h1>When Inactive</h1>
    <p><strong>Run at priority</strong> Choose which priority
    WinUAE should have when it's window is in the background. To
    save processing time, this should be set to Below Normal or
    lower.<br>
    <strong>Disable sound</strong> turns off audio output<br>
    <strong>Pause emulation</strong> will completely halt
    emulation<br>
    <strong>Disable game controllers</strong> will disable imputs
    from game controllers</p>
    <h1>When Minimized</h1>
    <p>These options are identical to the ones in the Inactive
    section, but they only apply when the window has been
    minimized, and isn't just in the background.</p>
    <h1>File Extension Associations</h1>
    <p>File associations enable double click functionality in
    Windows, and can be changed by either double clicking an entry
    in the list or using the <strong>Associate all</strong> and
    <strong>Disassociate all</strong> buttons. An asterisk
    indicates that the file extension is associated with
    WinUAE.</p>
