    <p>These settings let you set up how much memory you will
    allocate (steal) from Windows.</p><img class="center" src=
    "ram.png" alt="WinUAE - RAM">
    <p>With these track bars you can control the settings for the
    RAM, read-write memory for programs and data, for your emulated
    Amiga, and what types of memory to emulate.</p>
    <h2>Memory Settings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chip RAM</strong> is for the Amiga's custom chip
      especially used by graphics and sound to store images and
      sound information when using OCS, ECS or AGA modes. On a real
      Amiga, 2MB is the maximum but you can have up to 8MB with
      WinUAE!</li>
      <li><strong>Z2 Fast RAM</strong> is used by the Amiga's
      Processor. Its called Fast RAM for two reasons, one is that
      the processor does not have to share this ram with the custom
      chip set and the memory chips tend to be faster as well. You
      can specify up to 8MB of Fast RAM.</li>
      <li><strong>Slow RAM</strong> is similar to Fast RAM, but due
      to its connection via the Trapdoor of an A500 or via PCMCIA
      cards, it was slower than using Fast RAM. Only use this if
      certain games accepted this than Fast RAM.</li>
      <li><strong>Z3 Fast</strong> is similar to Fast RAM but
      supplied via the Zorro 3 slots on big box Amigas. You can
      have up to 1GB (up from 256MB) of this RAM!</li>
      <li><strong>32-bit Chip</strong> is a new option from v2.20
      where you can select None, 16, 32 64, 12,8 256, 512 Mb or 1GB
      of Chip RAM.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advanced Memory Settings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Z2 Fast RAM</strong> Select 1 to 4 settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory.</strong> Select RAM from 0 to 8 MB RAM
      for board.</li>
      <li><strong>Edit Autoconfig data</strong> Change the
      Manufacture code, Product code and Autoconfig data
      values.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual configuration</strong> Change the Address
      range values.</li>
      <li><strong>Z3 mapping mode.</strong> Select Automatic, UAE
      or real Zorro 3 mapping mode.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory board</strong> Select a UAE, DKB, Kupke or
      Supra memory board.</li>
    </ul>
