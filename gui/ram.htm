  <p>These settings let you set up how much memory you will allocate
    (steal) from Windows.</p>
  <img class="center" src="ram.png" alt="WinUAE - RAM">
  <p>With these 5 trackbars you are able to control the settings for
    the RAM (Random Access Memory, read-write memory for programs and data, for your emulated Amiga, and what types of memory to emulate. If you
    select more RAM than your Computer has, Windows will swap the content of the &quot;memory&quot; to
    the harddisk which is very slow.</p>
  <h2>Memory Settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chip RAM</strong> is for the Amiga's custom chip 
      especially used by graphics and sound to store images and sound information 
      when using OCS, ECS or AGA modes. On a real Amiga, 2MB is the maximum but 
      you can have upto 8MB with WinUAE!</li>
    <li><strong>Z2 Fast RAM</strong> is used by the Amiga's Processor. 
      Its called Fast RAM for two reasons, one is that the processor does not 
      have to share this ram with the custom chip set and the memory chips tend 
      to be faster as well. You can specify upto 8MB of Fast RAM.</li>
    <li><strong>Slow RAM</strong> is similar to Fast RAM, but due 
      to its connection via the Trapdoor of an A500 or via PCMCIA cards, it was 
      slower than using Fast RAM. Only use this if certain games accepted this 
      than Fast RAM.</li>
    <li><strong>Z3 Fast</strong> is similar to Fast RAM but supplied 
      via the Zorro 3 slots on big box Amigas. You can have upto 1GB (up from 
      256MB) of this RAM!</li>
    <li><strong>32-bit Chip</strong> is a new option from v2.20 where you can select None, 16, 32 64, 12,8 256, 512 Mb or 1GB of Chip RAM.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Advanced Memory Settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Z2 Fast RAM</strong> Select 1 to 4 settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory.</strong> Select  RAM from 0 to 8 MB RAM for board.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Autoconfig data</strong> Change the Manufacture code, Product code and Autoconfig data values.</li>
    <li><strong>Manual configuration</strong> Change the Address range values.</li>
    <li><strong>Z3 mapping mode.</strong> Select Automatic, UAE or real Zorro 3 mapping mode.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory board</strong> Select a UAE, DKB, Kupke or Supra memory board.</li>
