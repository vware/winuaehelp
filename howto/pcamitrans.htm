    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>You may need to transfer files between a computer where the
    emulation is run and a real Amiga. There are several options to
    choose from, each with pros and cons. In either case, you ought
    to read the documentation for the programs that you use for the
    transfer.</p>
    <h1>Serial Cable</h1>
    <p>If you are using a null modem cable, you will need a
    terminal program on your Windows machine and your Amiga. 68000
    equipped Amigas are only able to reach approximately 3000cps
    through the null modem cable. This speed is achieved with the
    standard serial.device or the new baudbandit.device There are
    some tools available which can speed up the connection speed up
    to 5500cps. For more help on how to set up a serial transfer
    see <a href="../links.htm">ADF Sender Terminal FAQ</a> and
    <a href="../links.htm#tools">WarTrans</a>. The <a href=
    "../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> is a great source for such
    tools such as TwinExpress and AmiTrans.</p>
    <p>All you need is the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Terminal software for Amiga and PC, preferably ones than
      can do Binary Transfers using common protocols such as Kermit
      and X/Y/ZModem. Amiga term programs include NComm, JRComm,
      and Term. PC term programs include Terminal and
      Terminus.</li>
      <li>A commonly used program called Twin Express can be used
      instead or <em>PC2Ami</em> or <a href=
      "../links.htm#tools">AmigaTrans</a> or Amiga Explorer from
      <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a>.
      </li>
      <li>A serial cable with 9pin end for PC and 25 pin end for
      Amiga. It has to be a null-modem cable which means that lines
      2 and 3 have to cross over to receive/transmit between peers
      and line 7 for control signals. See <a href=
      "../links.htm#help">RS232 cable information</a> for a null
      modem cable specification.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect the computers with serial lead and load up the
      software on each end.</li>
      <li>Start binary receive on one end using one of the
      protocols common to both programs.</li>
      <li>Start binary transmit on the other and load the file to
      be transmitted, it should then transfer to the other end in
      seconds/minutes depending on size.</li>
      <li>Further details of networking can be found at <a href=
      "../links.htm#help">Amiga Emulation FAQ</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Floppy Disks</h1>
    <p>If you have an Amiga with OS 2.0 or later, you may use
    <strong>CrossDOS</strong>. It is a part of the AmigaOS and
    enables you to read and write DOS formatted floppies on your
    Amiga. <strong>MessyDOS</strong> or <strong>MSH</strong> is a
    freeware program with the same functionality. It can be found
    on Aminet. If you do not have a high density floppy drive in
    your Amiga, you will have to use 720kB formatted disks.
    Compress the disk image with - for example - LHA and copy the
    compressed file on the floppy. Copy the file to your Windows
    machine and decompress it.</p>
    <h1>Compact Flash Card</h1>
    <p>If your PC or Mac has a Compact Flash reader installed and
    have a real Amiga, you can install <a href=
    "../links.htm#tools">EasyADF</a> which includes a CF card
    reader which allows you to easily create, read and transfer ADF
    or other files between the Amiga and your Mac or PC to run on
    your Emulator.</p>
    <h1>Direct Copy</h1>
    <p>If you have a PC with 2 floppy drives then you can use
    <a href="../links.htm#tools">Disk2FDI</a> which will allow you
    to read an Amiga disk in A: and read and transfer the contents
    to the B: drive. The FDI files can then be directly read with
    WinUAE.</p>
    <h1>Network</h1>
    <p>If your Amiga has a network card, this is probably the
    fastest and most convenient way of exchanging data with the
    rest of the world. You may use <a href=
    "../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto's</a> Amiga Explorer program to
    set up a PC to Amiga link and use a friendly front end program
    to transfer programs to and from your PC and your Amiga.<br>
    You can also use AmigaToPC, which is a professional network
    software setup, and can be found at our links page in the
    <a href="../links.htm#tools">tools section</a>.</p>
