    <h1>Requirements</h1>
    <p>It is only allowed to either use OS3.5 or 3.9 on 1 Computer
    at the same time. Read the license carefully.<br>
    Booting off any Workbench ADF should be sufficient to install
    AmigaOS 3.5 or 3.9, make sure you have correct access to your
    CD-ROM drive (see below).<br>
    To install AmigaOS versions 3.5 and 3.9, you have to make sure
    you set the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU emulation set to 68020</li>
      <li>Kickstart ROM version 3.1</li>
      <li>Sound emulation enabled</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Prepare emergency disk for CD-ROM access</h1>
    <p>Here we go:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your emulated Amiga with WinUAE and "insert" the ADF
      in a floppy drive</li>
      <li>Open the file devs/dosdrivers/emergency_CD on the disk
      with a texteditor</li>
      <li>Change the line device = "xxxxxx" to device =
      "uaescsi.device"</li>
      <li>Change UnitNum if needed</li>
      <li>Change the text MaxTransfer = xxxxxxx to MaxTransfer =
      0xFFFF<br>
      If you get read/write errors from CD use a value of 0x1FFF
      instead</li>
      <li>Save the changed file to disk</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Crashes during install?</h1>
    <p>Try changing the Sound options to a better level, e.g. 16
    bit and 44.1 kHz; change the CPU settings to adjustable and
    level 1. Alternatively, remove the references to playing sounds
    (such as the clapping noise) from the installer script if you
    know what you are doing.<br>
    There is an update available for AmigaOS 3.9 called a <em>Boing
    Bag</em> and to get it to install on WinUAE you need a patch
    available from <a href="../links.htm#original">Amiga,
    Inc</a>.</p>
    <h1>Installing OS3.9 using an AmiKit installation</h1>
    <p>If you don't have <a href="../links.htm#tools">AmiKit</a>,
    it is recommended to install it. This is the fastest way to get
    a working OS 3.9 installation.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot from Host machine</li>
      <li>Copy kick.rom to AmiKit/ROMs folder</li>
      <li>Optionally, copy Picasso96.lha to AmiKit/RabbitHole
      folder</li>
      <li>Insert the OS 3.9 CD</li>
      <li>Run Amikit.exe program and click Configure to import
      AmigaOS files</li>
      <li>Select 1366x768 32bit screen mode</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> If you get CD read errors you need
    reduce the max transfer rate in your CD-ROM driver
    settings.</p>
