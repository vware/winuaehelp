    <p>The Zorro bus is the standard for expansion cards on the
    bigger Amiga models. One of the main features of the Zorro bus
    is <a href="autoconfig.htm">Autoconfig</a>.</p>
    <h2>Zorro</h2>
    <p>The Zorro bus was introduced with the Amiga 1000. Cards
    based on the original Zorro bus are not compatible with the
    later versions.</p>
    <h2>Zorro-II</h2>
    <p>The 16 bit wide Zorro-II was introduced with the A2000.</p>
    <h2>Zorro-III</h2>
    <p>Zorro-III had its premiere with the A3000. This 32 bits wide
    bus was one of the fastest bus systems at the time it was
    released. It's also downwards compatible with the Zorro-II bus.
    By multiplexing signal lines, the connectors between the two
    latest Zorro versions remained unchanged. The Amiga could
    automatically detect if a 32 bit enabled card was in a slot,
    and then use the faster Zorro-III mode.</p>
    <h2>PCI</h2>
    <p>With the PowerPC and modern computer architechture, the
    standard Peripheral Component Interconnect (<a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI">PCI</a>) bus
    system is used which supports functions found on the processor
    bus but in a standard format and is independant of the
    processor's native bus. Devices connection to the bus appear to
    be connected to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the
    processor's address space.</p>
