    <p>The Zorro bus is the standard for expansion cards on the
    bigger Amiga models. One of the main features of the Zorro bus
    is <a href="autoconfig.htm">Autoconfig</a>.</p>
    <h1>Zorro</h1>
    <p>The Zorro bus was introduced with the Amiga 1000. Cards
    based on the original Zorro bus are not compatible with the
    later versions.</p>
    <h1>Zorro-II</h1>
    <p>The 16 bit wide Zorro-II was introduced with the A2000.</p>
    <h1>Zorro-III</h1>
    <p>Zorro-III had its premiere with the A3000. This 32 bit wide
    bus was one of the fastest bus systems at the time it was
    released. It's also backward compatible with the Zorro-II bus.
    By multiplexing signal lines, the connectors between the two
    latest Zorro versions remained unchanged. The Amiga could
    automatically detect if a 32 bit enabled card was in a slot,
    and then use the faster Zorro-III mode.</p>
