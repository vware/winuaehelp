    <p>Brian King, the man from Seattle, has been a long time
    supporter of UAE. He entered the team in 1996 and is known as
    one of the main guys behind WinUAE, which he maintained for
    more than 5 years. He gave up due to a lack of time and handed
    over to <a href="toniwilen.htm">Toni Wilen</a>.</p>
    <p>Brian was interviewed by Malc Jennings from <a href=
    "../links.htm#help">Amiga Legal Emulation</a>.</p>
    <h1>Interview:</h1>
    <p>Q: To start off, have you ever owned a real Amiga?<br>
    A: Yes. Several Amigas in my lifetime. Started with a used
    A1000, graduated to an A2000 with 040 accelerator. Eventually
    got an A1200 with 030 accelerator, and then briefly had an
    A3000T before it got stolen. Finally ended up with an A3000
    here.</p>
    <p>Q: About how much per year did/do you spend on
    hardware/software for the Amiga?<br>
    A: $1000</p>
    <p>Q: What made you decide to code/help code an Amiga
    emulator?<br>
    A: It just seemed like a great way to keep the Amiga alive,
    especially combined with the rapid pace of PC-hardware
    development and CPU speed, when compared to the high prices and
    slow speeds of newer Amiga hardware.</p>
    <p>Q: What is your main role in the team?<br>
    A: I primarily just work on the Windows port of UAE, from
    Linux. I have added some core features to UAE (such as
    Picasso96 RTG support), by implementing them first on
    WinUAE.</p>
    <p>Q: Are there any other projects you are working on at the
    moment?<br>
    A: No, my full-time job keeps my far too busy.</p>
    <p>Q: Are there any new features users should expect in the
    future releases of WinUAE?<br>
    A: Still hoping for AHI audio-support, along with better/faster
    Picasso96 support.</p>
    <p>Q: How many people are working on WinUAE in total?<br>
    A: Five or six. Bernd Schmidt contributes the most, via the
    core UAE code on Linux. Toni Wilen contributes alot of the disk
    and custom-chip emulation, including AGA support. Bernie Meyer
    did the JIT engine on Linux, which I ported into WinUAE. Bernd
    Roesch has been contributing alot of small fixes and
    enhancements. And I tend to do the "dirty work" of merging all
    these things together into a packaged installer.</p>
    <p>Q: For the technical people out there, what language(s)
    are/is used to code WinUAE?<br>
    A: C and Assembly.</p>
    <p>Q: Do you use any other programs during the development of
    WinUAE?<br>
    A: VisualC++, GCC.</p>
    <p>Q: How much progress do you feel WinUAE has made over the
    years?<br>
    A: Limited progress, based on the amount of time I have to
    contribute to it. In some areas its gotten a lot better
    (application support, emulation speed, compatibility) and in
    some areas its gotten worse (custom-chip emulation speed).</p>
    <p>Q: What is/was the most difficult part of the Amiga to
    emulate?<br>
    A: I imagine that the interaction between the custom h/w is the
    most difficult, with copper/disk/sprite/sound all churning away
    simultaneously. Toni or Bernd could answer this question
    better.</p>
    <p>Q: How much experience do you have as a programmer?<br>
    A: 15 years, with all sorts of languages: BASIC, Forth, 680x0
    Assembly, Pascal, Fortran, C, C++.</p>
    <p>Q: How long have you been working on WinUAE?<br>
    A: Too long! &lt;grin&gt; About 5 years now?</p>
    <p>Q: How do you feel about the legalities surrounding the
    emulation of the Amiga?<br>
    A: I understand the copyright issues, but its a shame that an
    older version of Kickstart isn't freely available. It would
    save me so much time answering the typical e-mail of "Where do
    I get a Kickstart ROM man?".</p>
    <p>Q: I know how you feel! anyway ... Have you ever developed
    software for anything other than the PC?<br>
    A: Yes. TRS-80 Colour Computer I, II, and III. Also Amiga
    software.</p>
    <p>Q: Which do you prefer, Windows or Workbench and why?<br>
    A: I prefer Windows, but only barely. Mostly due to superior
    development tools and capabilities of the OS, such as
    memory-protection.</p>
