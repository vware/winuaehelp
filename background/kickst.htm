    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Fast RAM</strong> is for CPU's use only,
      capacity are differentiated by different CPU.</li>
      <li><strong>Chip RAM</strong> is shared between CPU and
      specialized chips (up to 4MB). Equal to other computer's
      Video RAM and Sound Buffer. In an Amiga, it can also be used
      by the CPU. A500 or A600 had 512kB or 1MB or Chip RAM, A1200
      or A4000 had 2MB Chip. 8MB can be set for Chip RAM (no real
      Amiga had this!)</li>
      <li><strong>Slow</strong> RAM is extra RAM added via the A500
      trapdoor and is slower than Fast RAM, which is due to A500's
      architecture.</li>
      <li><strong>Z3-Fast</strong> is Fast RAM in Zorro 3 address
      space and can be used instead of Fast RAM.</li>
      <li><strong>RTG (graphics card)</strong> is memory for
      ReTargetable Graphics cards needed for Picasso 96
      support.</li>
      <li><strong>Motherboard Fast RAM</strong> is memory fitted to
      the motherboard.</li>
      <li><strong>Processor Slot Fast RAM</strong> is memory fitted
      to a board in processor slot.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Z2 Fast RAM board</strong> is memory
      fitted to a 2nd Zorro 2 board</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Z3-Fast and RTG RAM is supported on the 68020, 68020+FPU and
    68040 only. PPC systems will use Processor slot Fast RAM.<br>
    <br>
    Depending on the processor variant, you can expand the RAM up
    to 10 MB or theoretically up to 2 GB. The limit of 2 GB is
    valid for the Amiga models A3000 and A4000. On the Motherboard
    of these computers you can plug in up to 18 MB RAM, and for
    every of the four Zorro-III bus expansion you can expand the
    memory to the maximum!</p>
    <h2>Kickstart</h2>
    <p>Originally, the first Amiga (A1000) had a small bootstrap
    ROM, which contained code to load the basic operating system
    from a disk, known as the "<strong>Kickstart disk</strong>"
    into 256 kilobytes of RAM, which was then transformed into ROM
    by disabling the write signal to this RAM. Of course, the
    contents of this pseudo-ROM was lost when the computer was
    turned off. The point of using RAM was that Commodore wanted to
    be able to continue developing the operative system without
    requiring people to change ROMs when the new version was
    available; instead, they could just distribute new "Kickstart"
    disks, which they did three times, upgrading version 1.0 to
    1.1, 1.2. Version 2.0 was too large to fit into this
    pseudo-ROM, and that's the reason why Amiga 1000s cannot run
    the modern versions of the Amiga OS.</p>
