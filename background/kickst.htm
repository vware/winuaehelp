  <h2>RAM</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Fast RAM</strong> is for CPU's use only, capacity
      are differenciated by different CPU.</li>
    <li><strong>Chip RAM</strong> is shared between CPU and specialized
      chips (up to 4MB). Equal to other computer's Video RAM and Sound Buffer.
      In an Amiga, it can also be used by the CPU. A500 or A600 had 512kB or 1MB
      or Chip RAM, A1200 or A4000 had 2MB Chip. 8MB can be set for Chip RAM (no
      real Amiga had this!)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow</strong> RAM is extra RAM added via the A500
      trapdoor and is slower than Fast RAM, which is due to A500's architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Z3-Fast</strong> is Fast RAM in Zorro 3 address space
      and can be used instead of Fast RAM.</li>
    <li><strong>RTG (graphics card)</strong> is memory for ReTargetable
      Graphics cards needed for Picasso 96 support.</li>
    <li><strong>Motherboard Fast RAM</strong> is memory  fitted to the motherboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Processor Slot Fast RAM</strong> is memory fitted to a board in processor slot.</li>
    <li><strong>Second Z2 Fast RAM board</strong> is memory fitted to a 2nd Zorro 2 board</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Z3-Fast and RTG RAM is supported on the 68020, 68020+FPU and
    68040 only. PPC systems will use Processor slot Fast RAM.<br />
    <br />
    Depending on the processor variant, you can expand the RAM up to 10 MB or theoretically
    up to 2 GB. The limit of 2 GB is valid for the Amiga models A3000 and A4000.
    On the mainboard of these computers you can plug in up to 18 MB RAM, and for
    every of the four Zorro-III bus expansion you can expand the memory to the
    maximum! </p>
  <h2>Kickstart</h2>
  <p>Originally, the first Amiga (A1000) had a small bootstrap ROM,
    which contained code to load the basic operating system from a disk, known
    as the &quot;<strong>Kickstart disk</strong>&quot; into 256 kilobytes of RAM,
    which was then transformed into ROM by disabling the write signal to this RAM.
    Of course, the contents of this pseudo-ROM was lost when the computer was turned
    off. The point of using RAM was that Commodore wanted to be able to continue
    developing the operative system without requiring people to change ROMs when
    the new version was available; instead, they could just distribute new &quot;Kickstart&quot; disks,
    which they did three times, upgrading version 1.0 to 1.1, 1.2. Version 2.0
    was too large to fit into this pseudo-ROM, and that's the reason why Amiga
    1000s cannot run the modern versions of the Amiga OS.</p>
