<p><u>RAM:</u></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>Fast RAM</b> is for CPU's use only, capacity are differenciated by 
    different CPU.</li>
  <li><b>Chip RAM</b> is shared between CPU and specialized chips (up to 4MB). 
    Equal to other computer's Video RAM and Sound Buffer. In an Amiga, it can 
    also be used by the CPU. A500 or A600 had 512K or 1Mb or Chip RAM, A1200 or 
    A4000 had 2Mb Chip. 8Mb can be set for Chip RAM (no real Amiga had this!)</li>
  <li><b>Slow</b> RAM is extra RAM added via the A500 trapdoor is a slower than 
    Fast RAM (this is due to A500's architecture).</li>
  <li><b>Z3-Fast</b> is Fast RAM in Zorro 3 address space and can be used instead 
    of Fast RAM.</li>
  <li><b>RTG (graphics card)</b> is memory for ReTargetable Graphics cards needed 
    for Picasso 96 support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Z3-Fast and RTG RAM is supported on the 68020, 68020+FPU and 68040 only.<br>
  <br>
  Depending on the processor variant, you can expand the RAM up to 10 MB or theoretically 
  up to 2 GB. The limit of 2 GB is valid for the Amiga models A3000 and A4000. 
  On the mainboard of these computers you can plug in up to 18 MB RAM, and for 
  every of the four Zorro-III bus expansion you can expand the memory to the maximum!

<p><u>Kickstart:</u></p>
<p>Orignially, the first Amiga (A1000) had a small bootstrap ROM, which contained 
  code to load the basic operating system from a disk, known as the &quot;<strong>Kickstart 
  disk</strong>&quot; into 256 kilobytes of RAM, which was then transformed into 
  ROM by disabling the write signal to this RAM. Of course, the contents of this 
  pseudo-ROM was lost when the computer was turned off. The point of using RAM 
  was that Commodore wanted to be able to continue developing the operative system 
  without requiring people to change ROMs when the new version was available; 
  instead, they could just distribute new &quot;Kickstart&quot; disks, which they 
  did three times, upgrading version 1.0 to 1.1, 1.2. Version 2.0 was too large 
  to fit into this pseudo-ROM, and that's the reason why Amiga 1000s cannot run 
  the modern versions of the Amiga OS. </p>
