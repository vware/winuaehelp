    <p>The Kickstart, a ROM chip which contains essential parts of
    the Operating System and an Amiga can not boot without it.</p>
    <h1>Kickstart Disk</h1>
    <p>Originally, the first Amiga (A1000) had a small bootstrap
    ROM, which contained code to load the basic operating system
    from a disk, known as the "<strong>Kickstart disk</strong>"
    into 256 kilobytes of RAM, which was then transformed into ROM
    by disabling the write signal to this RAM. Of course, the
    contents of this pseudo-ROM was lost when the computer was
    turned off. The point of using RAM was that Commodore wanted to
    be able to continue developing the operating system without
    requiring people to change ROMs when a version was available;
    instead, they could just distribute new "Kickstart" disks,
    which they did three times, upgrading version 1.0 to 1.1 and
    later 1.2.</p>
    <h1>Kickstart ROM</h1>
    <p>Version 2.0 was too large to fit into this pseudo-ROM, so
    the Kickstart was stored on ROM chips directly. This is the
    reason why Amiga 1000s cannot run more modern versions of
    AmigaOS.</p>
