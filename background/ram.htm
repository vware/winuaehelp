    <p>The Amiga's unique hardware design is also reflected in how
    RAM is used.</p>
    <h2>Amiga RAM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Fast RAM</strong> is for CPU's use only,
      capacity are differentiated by different CPU.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chip RAM</strong> is shared between CPU and
        <a href="custchips.htm">Custom Chips</a> (up to 4MB),
        similar to other computers' Video RAM and Sound Buffer. In
        an Amiga, it can also be used by the CPU. A500 or A600 had
        512kB or 1MB or Chip RAM, A1200 or A4000 had 2MB Chip. In
        WinUAE, up to 8MB can be configured (no real Amiga had
        this!)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Slow</strong> RAM is extra RAM added via the A500
      trapdoor and is slower than Fast RAM, which is due to A500's
      architecture.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Z3-Fast</strong> is Fast RAM in <a href=
        "zorro.htm">Zorro 3</a> address space and can be used
        instead of Fast RAM.
      </li>
      <li><strong>RTG (graphics card)</strong> is memory for
      ReTargetable Graphics cards needed for Picasso 96
      support.</li>
      <li><strong>Motherboard Fast RAM</strong> is memory fitted to
      the motherboard.</li>
      <li><strong>Processor Slot Fast RAM</strong> is memory fitted
      to a board in processor slot.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Z2 Fast RAM board</strong> is memory
      fitted to a 2nd Zorro 2 board.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Z3-Fast and RTG RAM is supported on the 68020, 68020+FPU and
    68040 only. PPC systems will use Processor slot Fast RAM.</p>
    <p>Depending on the processor variant, you can expand the RAM
    up to 10 MB or theoretically up to 2 GB. The limit of 2 GB is
    valid for the Amiga models A3000 and A4000. On the Motherboard
    of these computers you can plug in up to 18 MB RAM, and for
    every of the four Zorro-III bus expansion you can expand memory
    to the maximum.</p>
