<p class="headline1">Autoconfig</p>
<p class="text">On other computer systems you always had to configure cards manually
  via &quot;jumpers&quot; or DIP switches for certain address areas or interrupt
  numbers. This is very tedious and, in practice, it requires in-depth knowledge
  of the system to avoid conflicts among different cards used simultaneously.
  The Autoconfig mechanism of the Amiga system automates this procedure totally,
  so that the user never has to bother with such details. Thus, expanding an
  Amiga system is extremely simple and without problems.</p>
