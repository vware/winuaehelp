  <p class="normal">On other computer systems you always had to configure cards manually
    via &quot;jumpers&quot; or DIP switches for certain address areas or interrupt
    numbers. This is very tedious and, in practice, it requires in-depth knowledge
    of the system to avoid conflicts among different cards used simultaneously.
    AutoConfig was introduced with the Amiga 1000 in the year 1987, and automated
    this procedure totally, so that the user never had to bother with such details.
    An equivalent of this technology - called Plug and Play - was released by Microsoft
    with the introduction of Windows 95. </p>
  <p class="normal">When the Amiga is switched on, the Kickstart begins to search
    for an expansion card every expansion slot. When a card is found, information
    about its type and needed resources is read out of that card. The Kickstart
    then automatically allocates all necessary resources. The important difference
    to Plug and Play is that Amigas already allocate all expansions before the
    operating system is loaded. On Windows machines, the operating system itself
    searches and invokes expansion cards. AutoConfig is, regarding to that, similar
    to Plug and Play in the sense of the word, although the mechanism is different.</p>
