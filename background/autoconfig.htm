    <p>On early computing systems, configuration of extension
    hardware usually involved configuring cards manually via
    "jumpers" or DIP switches for certain address areas or
    interrupt numbers. This is a very tedious and error-prone
    process, and in practice, requires in-depth knowledge of the
    system to avoid conflicts among different cards used
    simultaneously. AutoConfig was introduced with the Amiga 1000
    in the year 1987, and automated this procedure totally, so that
    the user never had to bother with such details. A similar
    technology - called Plug&amp;Play - was released by Microsoft
    with the introduction of Windows 95.</p>
    <p>When the Amiga is switched on, the Kickstart begins to
    search for an expansion card every expansion slot. When a card
    is found, information about its type and needed resources is
    read from that card. The Kickstart then automatically allocates
    all necessary resources. The important difference to
    Plug&amp;Play is that Amigas already allocate all expansions
    before the operating system is loaded. On Windows machines, the
    operating system itself searches and invokes expansion
    cards.</p>
