    <p>On other computer systems you always had to configure cards
    manually via "jumpers" or DIP switches for certain address
    areas or interrupt numbers. This is very tedious and, in
    practice, it requires in-depth knowledge of the system to avoid
    conflicts among different cards used simultaneously. AutoConfig
    was introduced with the Amiga 1000 in the year 1987, and
    automated this procedure totally, so that the user never had to
    bother with such details. An equivalent of this technology -
    called Plug and Play - was released by Microsoft with the
    introduction of Windows 95.</p>
    <p>When the Amiga is switched on, the Kickstart begins to
    search for an expansion card every expansion slot. When a card
    is found, information about its type and needed resources is
    read out of that card. The Kickstart then automatically
    allocates all necessary resources. The important difference to
    Plug and Play is that Amigas already allocate all expansions
    before the operating system is loaded. On Windows machines, the
    operating system itself searches and invokes expansion cards.
    AutoConfig is, regarding to that, similar to Plug and Play in
    the sense of the word, although the mechanism is different.</p>
