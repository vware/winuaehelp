    <p>The so-called "Custom Chips" are arguably the most famous
    and differentiating feature of Amigas, compared to other
    computing architectures. They allowed the - for it's time -
    very advanced capabilities.<br>
    In the first one, the A1000, the chips "Agnus", "Paula", and
    "Denise" did the hard work. Together, they formed a specialized
    multiprocessor system that took much of the time-critical load
    off of the main processor. This included the display of image
    information, 4-channel sound output, floppy control, general
    DMA control, and much more.<br>
    In the latest Amigas you find the "AGA chipset", which consists
    of the original "Paula" and the advanced chips named "Alice"
    (the replacement for Agnus) and "Lisa" (the replacement for
    Denise).</p>
    <h1>Chipset Generations</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the
      first chipset, used in the Amiga 1000. It consists of the
      chips Paula, Agnus, and Denise. With these, you can display
      graphics in resolutions up to 640x512 and in up to 4096
      colors.</li>
      <li><strong>ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was the
      next generation of Amiga chipsets. The chip names remained
      unchanged, except some minor additions like "Fat Agnus". Only
      Agnus and Denise were changed. Compared to OCS, they provided
      higher resolutions, but no expansion of the color palette so
      far.</li>
      <li><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture):
      This is the latest and most advanced chipset. The current
      generation was created in the labs as AA chipset (for
      Advanced Amiga), but in some countries it was later marketed
      as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture).<br>
      Agnus was replaced by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The
      resolutions now reach up to 1280x512 in VGA scan frequencies.
      The color palette is now 24 bits or 16.8 million colors. You
      can display up to 256 colors simultaneously or in HAM mode
      more than 640,000. Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS
      modes is assured.</li>
      <li><strong>Discrete graphics</strong> and
      <strong>RTG.</strong> After AGA, the Amiga used discrete
      graphics cards to improve display resolutions and color
      depths but lost some of the features like HAM, Copper effects
      and Sprites on the earlier boards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Paula</h1>
    <p>The Amiga's third custom chip, <strong>Paula</strong> took
    care of audio generation and I/O. There were four voices of
    sound, output as two (stereo) channels. Nine octaves were
    available with both amplitude (e.g. speech playback) and
    frequency modulation.<br>
    Amplitude modulation was the normal way of generating sound,
    with the DMA chip reading amplitude data from memory and the
    I/O chip translating the digital data to an analog voltage
    level. Frequency modulation always took place "on top of"
    amplitude modulation, modulating the frequency with which the
    DMA chip would read new amplitude data. One voice's amplitude
    data was usurped to modulate the frequency of another voice.
    Frequency modulation was not needed to play normal tones, and
    usually had little to do with the perceived pitch of the actual
    sound played, at least as experienced by a human listener.</p>
    <h1>HAM</h1>
    <p>The HAM (Hold And Modify) mode is one of several graphics
    modes that's provided by the Amiga custom chips from their
    start. With HAM, you can display many colors simultaneously
    while using up very little memory. Simply put, it's sort of a
    hardware data compression method by a factor of ca. three.
    Still you can display practically all colors of the palette on
    screen. This modification of one color component serves to
    render soft color transitions very accurately, as they are
    typical for natural pictures like portraits. In the HAM8 mode
    you can theoretically display more than 640,000 colors
    simultaneously on screen. The dependence on previous pixel
    contents sets certain limits, so that the HAM mode is less
    suited for realtime action. But in still pictures or
    precalculated animations, it lives with its many colors. Due to
    data compression, the HAM mode is also responsible for the
    Amiga being so famous for animations that can run at full
    speed, even on smaller Amiga models. Basically you can display
    all 16.8 million colors of the 24-bit palette in HAM8 mode.</p>
    <h1>Copper</h1>
    <p>Copper is the short name for a "Coprocessor" which is
    integrated into the Amiga custom chips. It makes fast action
    games possible, as well as unbelievable color effects, and the
    capability to drag down a screen partially on the Amiga's
    display and thus show several screens at once. Technically, the
    Copper is a highly specialized microprocessor which knows only
    three different commands, but can process these extremely fast
    and efficiently. It provides the ability to change e.g.
    graphics mode, color values, or sprite definitions somewhere at
    a well defined location within the screen. This way the Amiga
    can display many different actions on one screen simultaneously
    without activity by the main CPU.</p>
    <h1>Blitter</h1>
    <p>Blitter is the short name for another graphics coprocessor
    which is part of the Amiga custom chips. With it you can copy
    rectangular image parts extremely fast to other areas. During
    this, you can take up to three source data areas and perform
    logical operations on them. This allows e.g. to define certain
    color values of the copied object as transparent, thus not
    modifying the destination area. As an add-on, the Blitter can
    also draw lines and fill areas fast. All in all it serves to
    provide extremely fast, animated graphics that can be designed
    to be especially realistic.</p>
