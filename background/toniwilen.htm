    <p>Toni Wilen is the maintainer of WinUAE, he took over this
    position from <a href="brianking.htm">Brian King</a>. He has
    been at the helm for many years now, and has become famous for
    his incredible speed of answering bug reports, fixing the
    reported issues, as well as for implementing a big bunch of
    features users would not want to miss in WinUAE.</p>
    <p>Also, Toni was interviewed by Georg Veichtlbauer on the 19th
    of November, 2002. It may be a bit lengthy but sure worth a
    read.</p>
    <h2>Interview:</h2>
    <p>Q: Would you tell a few things about yourself Toni?<br>
    A: I am from Finland, 27 years old, working as
    programmer/sysadmin. I haven't really done anything lately than
    working, watching Anime, reading Manga and programming
    something stupid and of course idling :).</p>
    <p>Q: Did you ever own an original Amiga?<br>
    A: Of course, and many models... A1000 was my first Amiga (1988
    or so), then I had two A500s (another was my brothers) and
    later two A1200's (again one for my brother). Now I have one
    A500 and A1200 for emulator compatibility testing :).</p>
    <p>Q: When (and how) did your programming career start?<br>
    A: My first computer was Spectra Video svi-328. My first
    "programming" was writing and modifying some basic programs
    from computer magazines. I think I was 9 or 10 when I had my
    first computer :). I had c64 about 2-3 years later, wrote some
    stupid programs with C64-assembler...</p>
    <p>Q: How did you get involved in UAE?<br>
    A: I think I saw someone say something like "it is impossible
    to emulate AGA" or something (I believe everything is
    possible). Then I started to examine UAE's code and add AGA
    support slowly (and this is true!). It took about 0.5 years
    until I understood UAE and even now I don't understand
    everything.</p>
    <p>Q: You did not use any AGA documentation?<br>
    A: The unofficial aga.guide is the only documentation, but I
    knew it is correct because I programmed some AGA programs on my
    A1200 ages ago...</p>
    <p>Q: Why did you decide to realize it with UAE instead of
    Fellow?<br>
    A: Choice was easy, UAE was in C. I hate Intel assembler!</p>
    <p>Q: How much progress do you think UAE has made over the past
    years?<br>
    A: Too much? :) I'd say A500 emulation is very close. Only 100%
    correct cycle-exact CPU/Blitter emulation is not yet complete
    (because there is no documentation, you have to run
    test-programs on a real A500 to find everything out. Very time
    consuming. I am not really interested...). Of course 68020+
    emulation needs MMU support (but probably not useful until
    everyone have 4GHz+ CPU :).</p>
    <p>Q: What are the main features you implemented in
    UAE/WinUAE?<br>
    A: AGA, much more compatible disk emulation, more compatible
    Blitter emulation, rdb, booting from real HDD's, more
    compatible sprite emulation, CD32, A1000 boot ROM, state save,
    drive LEDs :), partial CDTV (because of missing hardware
    documentation).</p>
    <p>Q: Why did you accept the position as WinUAE maintainer? It
    sure isn't the nicest and best paid "job" you could get...<br>
    A: Because I wanted to continue improving UAE :). Sending
    patches to someone else is much more complex, and anyway, Brian
    wasn't interested in continuing for a long time. I'd probably
    have become win32 maintainer even if I didn't want :).</p>
    <p>Q: Do you actually use WinUAE? I remember Brian saying he
    didn't do much with it apart from coding it...<br>
    A: Yes, mostly for classic A500 demos and games.</p>
    <p>Q: How do you see the cooperation with the other coders of
    UAE?<br>
    A: Usually I disagree with Bernd Schmidt but unfortunately he
    has been too quiet lately. Unfortunately it appears only me and
    Bernd know how the UAE core works. Bernd Roesch and 2-3 other
    coders send me fixes for picasso96, bsdsocket etc., non-core
    emulation but thats it. Finding someone who knows Amiga
    hardware, has programmed demos/games on an Amiga, knows C
    (Amiga demos/games were mostly in assembler) and knows Unix or
    Windows programming is nearly impossible... and especially one
    who has time to learn how UAE works.</p>
    <p>Q: Are you working on other publicly available programs?<br>
    A: Great Nations (Civilization clone, don't know if I ever have
    time to continue), NHLinfo (EA Sports NHL-game editor, mostly I
    have lost interest on that too because all NHL games since 2001
    have been total crap), Filemaster for Amiga, and some other
    smaller Amiga programs.</p>
    <p>Q: What are you planning for the WinUAE future?<br>
    A: File system filenotification support,
    "sprites-outside-playfield" AGA-feature (but probably requires
    big rewrite of display code, don't expect too soon), Catweasel
    support, full CDTV emulation, MK3 (PCI) support.</p>
