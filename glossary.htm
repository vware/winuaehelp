  <p>Computer sciences have spawned many awkward terms and acronyms which are often hindering novice users to understand how-tos and manuals. Emulation some terms of its own, as does the Amiga, due to its unique hardware design. This pages aims to explain the most common terms.</p>
  <h2>General</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Term</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BIOS</td>
      <td>Basic Input Output System. Initializes the PC hardware in order to prepare the machine so programs can be run.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bus</td>
      <td>A subsystem that transfers data between computer components inside a computer or between computers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CPU</td>
      <td>Central Processing Unit. Also referred to as the &quot;processor&quot;, all calculations are done in this unit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FPU</td>
      <td>Floating Point Unit. In the early days, this was a seperate unit used for floating point calculations. Nowadays integrated in the main CPU.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>RAM</td>
      <td>Random Access Memory. Main type of storage for a computer to work with. It is by nature volatile memory, i.e. it gets cleared when the computer is shut down. For WinUAE RAM emulation, see <a href="background/kickst.htm">RAM &amp; Kickstart</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ROM</td>
      <td>Read Only Memory. Most commonly used to store Firmware, Kickstart, and BIOS programs. In contrary to RAM, it is not volatile.</td>
    </tr>
