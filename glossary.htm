    <p>Computer sciences have spawned many awkward terms and
    acronyms which are often hindering novice users to understand
    how-tos and manuals. Emulation some terms of its own, as does
    the Amiga, due to its unique hardware design. This pages aims
    to explain the most common terms.</p>

          RAM emulation, see <a href="background/kickst.htm">RAM &
          Kickstart</a>.
