    <p>Bernd, a German native, was the great mastermind of UAE. He
    started the main UAE development on the 25th of February, 1995.
    Bernd has continued updating UAE, incorporating contributions
    and making progress on the core that all other versions of UAE
    were derived of. In the year 2002 he began to loose interest in
    the development of the emulator.<br>
    These days, WinUAE still receives very frequent updates, which
    is why other developers moved on to port features of WinUAE in
    versions on other platforms. A good example for this is
    <a href="../links.htm#official">E-UAE</a>, which ports the
    WinUAE base back to Linux, where the original UAE came
    from.</p>
