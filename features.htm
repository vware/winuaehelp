    <p>WinUAE is a very feature-rich implementation of an
    Amiga:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Picasso96 RTG support, so that your Amiga can make use of
      all available display modes of your PC graphics-card. P96-RTG
      is implemented as a Zorro-III graphics-card to the
      Amiga.</li>
      <li>CD-ROM, CDTV and CD32 drive support, for accessing Amiga
      CD-ROM discs.</li>
      <li>Windows file-system support, so that your Amiga can use
      your PC HDD's file-system directly. Makes it easy to share
      files between Windows and the Amiga.</li>
      <li>Full hard disk support, for maximum compatibility, and
      reduced risk. HDToolbox, RDB and custom file systems
      supported. Able to mount real hard disks with RDB and
      Amithlon partitions. Kickstart 1.3 hardfiles now supported
      with FastFileSystem in KS ROMs directory.</li>
      <li>Zorro-III memory-expansion support, so that you can
      emulate an Amiga with up to 2GB of RAM.</li>
      <li>Super-Alice custom-chip, with up to 8 MB of Chip
      Memory.</li>
      <li>Virtual networking support, through either your Ethernet
      or Dial-Up Networking connection to the world.</li>
      <li>MIDI output support.</li>
      <li>JIT CPU emulation.</li>
      <li>Action Replay 1/2/3 support.</li>
      <li>Compressed Kickstart ROM support.</li>
      <li>All keys now usable as Amiga keys including Windows keys
      and are usable in Input-tab configuration.</li>
      <li>Floppy disk speed slider and configurable floppy drive
      types.</li>
      <li>Quickstart mode allows you to select pre-configured Amiga
      models</li>
      <li>Emulation of Motorola 68000 to 68030 CPU and from WinUAE
      v3.0.0 the PowerPC CPU using QEmu.</li>
      <li>Wide range of accelerator boards and expansions.</li>
      <li>And many, many more!</li>
    </ul>
